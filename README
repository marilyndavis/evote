INTRODUCTION

"The Clerk" is a specialized database server, specialized to keep
votes for a computer-connected community.

"eVote(R)" is any user interface that uses The Clerk.

eVote(R)/Clerk 2.5xx is the email user interface for taking polls
amongst the members of email lists.  It cooperates with Mailman or
Majordomo listservers.

FEATURES

  *  Enables any member of an email list to generate a new poll for
     the group.

  *  Polls can be:

        +  Public - where everyone can see everyone's votes, or
        +  Private - where no one can see anyone else's vote, or
        +  If-Voted - where everyone can see who voted, but not how
                      they voted.

        +  Numeric - where votes are from 1 to 10, or -10 to 10, etc., or
        +  Yes/No.

        +  Visible - where everyone can see the tally while the poll is
                     open, or
        +  Hidden -  where no one can see the results until the poll is
                     closed.

        +  Single item - or,
        +  Grouped items - where participants vote for one of a number
                     of choices, or for three of the choices, or they can
                     distribute their 100 vote points over the choices.

  * Supports petitions.  Petitions are generated and administered by the 
    members of a "petition" list.  Petition features:

        + Open for anyone to sign.
        + Supported in English, Spanish and French.  
        + Can be:
            - Signature-only petitions
            - Petitions with voting items
            - Petitions with forms
