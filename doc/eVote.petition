This list is for collaborative administration of petitions.  eVote's
petition facility allows a global vote in which the participants don't
subscribe to an email list.

We can talk to each other by sending messages to the petition list
address, just like a regular email list.  Also, we can take regular
polls between ourselves, *except* for [y/n] polls, as they will be
interpreted as a new petition and have a totally different behavior.

To receive instructions for taking a regular poll, send the command
"eVote help poll" to \list@\whereami.

All [y/n] polls in the "petition" list are assumed to be petitions,
not regular polls.  Therefore, to set up a petition, set up a visible
[y/n] poll in the petition list and the poll text becomes the petition
text.  Or you can use the special "eVote petition" command.  It is an
alias for "eVote poll [y/n] visible".  You still need to give either
"public" or "private" (if-voted has no meaning for petitions), i.e., a
complete command for a petition is:

eVote petition public
message:
We want change.


Generating Simple Petitions
========== ====== =========

To generate a simple petition, i.e., one without fields:

1.  Choose your subject line carefully, say "Save the World".

2.  Send a message to \list@\whereami with your subject.

3.  Make the message say:

---  cut  ---
eVote petition public
message:
Type in the text of your petition.
---  cut  ---

4.  Advertise the following instructions:

= * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * 

Instructions for Signing A Petition
============ === ======= = ========

1.  Send email to eVote@\whereami.

2.  Make your subject be "Save the World" (really, the subject line of
    your poll).

3.  Have the message be your name, affiliation, comments, whatever.

= * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * 

The signers of your petitions do not have to subscribe to your 
petition list or to any list to sign a petition.

If the message is blank, only the email signature will be recorded.
If the message contains text (other than "help" or "info"), the
message text will be included as a comment in the signature file.

If the petition requires the user to provide completed fields, (see
"Initializing Petitions With Forms" below) the message must contain
these fields or a instructions will be sent and the signature will not
be counted.

Getting Info About A Petition
======= ==== ===== = ========

When anyone signs your petition, they will be sent a receipt which
tells them the text of the petition and gives instructions for
unsigning and for seeing the signatures, if it's a PUBLIC petition.

Your audience can see the petition text without signing if they:

1.  Send email to eVote@\whereami.

2.  Make your subject be "Save the World" (really, the subject line of
your petition).

3.  Have the message say:

   info

Privacy
=======

The email addresses of the signers of petitions are not revealed to
anyone unless there is a "email:" field in the signature itself, and
that field either has an email address specified, or the word "Yes".
This field should be inserted into the form description as described
"Initializing Petitions With Forms" below.

There are two types of petitions:  "private" and "public".

If the petition is private, only the initiator of the petition can
retrieve the signatures, and the email addresses, and the initiator
must be trusted to behave responsibly with your information.  Of
course, the site administrator can also discover the email addresses.

If the petition is public, anyone on the petition list can retrieve
the signatures, but no one (except the site administrator) can
retrieve the email addresses.

"If-voted" has no meaning for petitions and is interpreted as
"private".

The "eVote members" command does not work for petition lists so that
the email addresses of your signers are secret.

Confirmation Of Signatures
============ == ==========

For security, you can instruct the software to generate and process a
"confirmation" message with each signature.  To do so, initialize your
petition with an additional keyword, "confirm".

eVote petition public confirm
message:
Stop globalization.
end

The keyword "confirm", if present, makes your petition secure.  When
someone sends in a signature, if the signature and form fields are
acceptable, a confirmation message goes back to the signer.  The
signer is instructed to reply-to the confirmation message and when
s/he does so, only then is the signature accepted into the data.

If you do not initialize your petition with the "confirm" keyword, and
later your petition comes under attack, the sysadmin can add the
confirm keyword to your petition while it is operating. 

See "Alterations on the Fly" below.

Initializing Petitions With Forms
============ ========= ==== =====

eVote's petition facility supports forms.  That is, eVote will
recognize field names in the signature message, demand that certain
fields be filled in, and demand that a certain format be followed in
the field for the signature to be accepted.

If the attempt to sign is rejected, an error message with polite
instructions will be returned.

To set up a petition that requires a form, your instruction to a
petition list might look like:

eVote petition public
form:
*name:
address:
city:
* state: XX
* zip: 99999
phone:
comment:
message:
Please fix the roof.
--- end of example ---

In this case signatures will be rejected if they don't include the
three fields, name, state, and zip.  That's the meaning of the '*' in
the first column.  

In the example, the required "name:" field must have something on it,
but only the existence of some text on the line is verified.  The
state field must be filled in with two letters.  The zip field must
contain 6 numbers, no more, no less.  You may mix X's and 9's in one
field's format.

The other, non-required, fields may or may not be in the signature and
if they are, they may be in any order.  X's and 9's can be included in
non-required fields but they will only be aids to the signers, they
are not checked.

The "comment:" field is special.  If it is in the list of fields, it
must be the last field.  The comment field allows the response to be
of any length, any number of lines.

Also, if there is no comment field, there is still a hidden comment
field.  Comments are always allowed in a petition with fields and any
text recognized as a comment from the signer is included in this
field.

The comment field can be a required field, just like any other field.

You can use any words or phrases for the names of your fields.  The
size limit is 40 characters.  You may not have two fields with exactly
the same name.

The "message:" line signals the end of the fields and all text after
that will be part of the petition text itself.

If you wish to add fields to a working petition, see "Alterations on
the Fly" below in the chapter, "eVote for Site Administrators".  You
need the assistance of the administrator to make changes on the fly.

Multi-Language Petitions
=====-======== =========

eVote's petition facility will parse the subject line of any message
coming into eVote_petition from the eVote@\whereami address and
determine if the subject exists as a petition title in any language
for any petition on any petition list at your facility.

Translations for subjects and petition texts can be supplied remotely
by the petition's author at the time of initialization, or they can be
added later by the site administrator.  See "Alterations On the Fly"
below.

Subject Lines
------- -----

If the subject of the petition is "Save the World", a signer or web
page can use "Save the World -es" to indicate that Spanish is desired.
Or, if you have provided the translation, they can use "Salve El
Mundo".

Initializing A Multi-Lingual Petition
------------ - ----- ------- --------

To facilitate multiple languages, the command to start a petition,
with the default title, "Governments" and with no forms goes like:

eVote petition public
message:
Please stop the governments.
-es: Gobiernos
Por favor alta los gobiernes.
-fr: Governieses
Si vu ple, altaze le governe.
---  end of example ---

For each non-default language, add a line with a language flag and the
translated title.  Follow that with the translation of the petition
text.

This produces a petition with the default language of English that
responds to the Spanish and French subjects, or to the language
flags "-es" or "-fr".

If you wish the default language to be French, the subject line for
the petition should be "Governieses -Fr" and then the message would be:

eVote petition public
message:
Si vu ple, altaze le governe.
-en: Governments
Please stop the governments.
-es: Gobiernos
Por favor alta los gobiernes.
---  end of example ---

More translations can be added by the site administrator after the
petition is already up and running.  See "Alterations on the
Fly" below.

Multi-Language Forms
-------------- -----

eVote's petition facility supports multi-language forms.  That is,
eVote will recognize field names, in the particular language, in the
signature message.  The format that eVote recognizes is:

eVote petition public
form:
*name: -es nombre: -fr namee:
address: -es direccion: -fr zeeaddress:
city: -es ciudad: -fr zeecity:
country: -es paiz: -fr countree: XX
comment: -es comento: -fr comente:
message:
Please stop the governments.
-es Goviernos
Por favor alta los gobiernes.
-fr Governieses
Si vu ple, altaze le governe.
---  end of example ---

If you wish to specify a format for one of your fields, do that just
after all the translations are listed.

Support for a new language can be added after the petition is
initialized but it must be done by the site administrator.

Required fields and formats work the same as in a single language
petition, above.

Voting Petitions
====== =========

Many times you want your signers to vote on a set of issues, not just
contribute a signature and a form.  eVote provides support for this 
in a flexible way.

Any regular poll type can be attached to a petition.  Initiate a
regular poll on your petition list with the title "La Consulta -eVote"
and it will attach itself to the "La Consulta" petition.  The "-eVote"
keyword at the end makes it all happen.  Your message may look like:

eVote poll group private visible
1. one [-1,1]
2. two [-1,1]
3. three [-1,1]
4. four [-1,1]
5. five [-1,1]
message:
This poll accompanies the petition on La Consulta.

In this case, the petition texts, in all languages, should explain
the 5 yes/no votes that are possible.  The "La Consulta -Es" petition
initiation might look like:

eVote petition public
form:
*pais: -en country: -fr pays:
*nombre: -en name: -fr nom: 
email: -en email: -it email:
message:

WWW Support For Your Petition
=== ======= === ==== ========

If your petition is promoted on a web page, it is possible to use
Javascript to make a button that sends email requests to service the
signing of petitions, the unsigning of petitions, even subscribing and
unsubscribing to lists, and all email commands.

Check out the petition page for "La Consulta":

http://www.deliberate.com/consulta

and for "Kopilli Ketzalli":

http://www.deliberate.com/aztec

You can copy these pages and then modify them to suit your petition.

The web pages you make for your petition can be mirrored on any
number of sites (a security feature) and they will all feed the
one petition.

WWW Reports
=== =======

Your petition web page, no matter where it is, can report the current
count of signatures.  eVote will use ftp to send the updates of the
count to a remote computer every time someone signs a petition or
removes a signature. This, however, must be coordinated with the
administrator of the eVoted site.

Your job will be to make your web page with the report of the number
of signers.  Make the number of signatures 0.  You can also have
a date updated on the web page.  For starting, put the current date
in your web page with the format:  Wed Sep 20 11:20:51 PDT 2000
which is the standard unix format.

Send your web pages to the system administrator of the eVoted site and
she can fix it up for you.  It is a piece of work to make this happen
so please be patient and understanding with your administrator.


Bad Signatures
=== ==========

If you wish to remove someone's signature from the petition, you can
do so if you know the password for the list.  The owner of the list
knows the password and will, perhaps, share it with you.

1.  Send a message to:

    \list@\whereami

2.  The subject must be the subject of the petition:

    Save The World

3.  The message should be

eVote approve <password> unsign <address> <address> <...>

This will remove the signature(s) from the signature file and and the
email address is removed from eVote's data.  The count is adjusted and
any reports attached to the petition are updated.


Alternations On The Fly
============ == === ===

Your petition can have certain alterations occur after the petition
signature collecting is in process.  However, these alterations must
be made by the site administrator.

The alterations that are supported are:

   Adding additional languages
   Adding dynamic WWW reports of signature counts
   Adding WWW support for signature gathering
   Turning on/off the confirm feature
   Changing the required fields

If you need these, you must contact the site administrator.
