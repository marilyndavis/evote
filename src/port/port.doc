This directory contains some tests.

First check that one user can run the demo interface.  Do a "make
clean" in this directory, and then a make so that the #defines are
good for testing.

Start The Clerk by typing "eVote" and then try 
"./eVote_test > test.out &".


First, as root, run addusr.linux make 100 dummy users: dum1 through
dum100.  This script makes a file, pp, in this directory.  You can
paste this file onto /usr/passwd to put these users in the password
file with no password and /usr for the home directory.  You might want
to delete them when you are finished testing.

Check that the flags in the makefile match those in eVoteui, for
example.  Run the makefile.  This makes a bunch of executables:
porttest and longtest are the main ones.  These call "dummy", a script
in this directory which changes the uid and runs the other
executables.

Using these programs, lots of users are on line simultaneously and
then dropped.  This exercises the IPC stuff and the voter listings
and droppings.  Look for trouble in the Clerk.log and enter ed0,
ed1, .. yourself and see that the data look right and that you
can do a who voted, a how voted, and vote yourself.

If you get some system errors when you run this, be sure that your
dummy users have permission to run fastvoter ...

Good luck.
