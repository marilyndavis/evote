trans.c is a program to aid in translating the human language strings
in computer code.  It finds all the phrases that the program outputs
and places them in a translation table.  For example, for the call

trans en fr code.c

2 files will be produced:

1.  code-fr.c             attempted translation
2.  en-fr.new             translation table entries that need 
                          translation to French

After translating the en-fr.new entries, the table should be renamed
"en-fr".  Then, a subsequent call to:

trans en fr code.c

will produce a better code-fr.c and, if all the strings have been 
translated, an empty en-fr.new.

It rewrites en-fr to be in alphabetic order and to have no duplicates.

Code Preparation Hints:

In writing C code, use multiple printfs to produce short translation
strings to avoid repetition in the table.

If you want a single character translated, put a comment on the same
line:

   case 'a':      /* add */

This comment will appear in the translation table so that the human
translator can translate to the appropriate letter.

Be sure to put only one 'c' -type character on each line in your code.

If the 'c' -type character has no associated comment, it will not
appear in the translation table and will not be translated.

Human Translator Tips:

Be careful to copy the blanks, new lines and tabs from one language to
the other.
