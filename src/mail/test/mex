message:
The March for Kopilli Ketzalli with Xokonoschtletl in Mexico March will be
from November 3 - 17, 2001 and then we will relax at Xokonoschtletl's
home from November 18 - 25, 2001.  Hotel rooms will be 3-4 per room;
camping will be in hammocks.  All meals will be provided.

I will send \$425 deposit for each person to:

    Yankuikanahuak
    2555 W. Middlefield, #150
    Mountain View, CA 94043

I understand that the \$425 deposit is necessary to guarantee my
reservation.

I also understand that the total cost is \$850 per person and I will
pay the remaining \$425 on arrival in Mexico March City.
