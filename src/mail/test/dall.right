         eVote yes

       To vote NO, your message should say:

         eVote no

       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic

louise5@somewhere.com's last eVote participation: 
	Fri May 24 04:44:15 2003

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 
1. 2
3. 1

Your vote of "1" on  choice #3. "what"
violates the sum-limit for "C".  
It is not accepted.

Note that you are forced to vote the minimum on all the choices.

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "2" on choice #1. "something".

Perhaps the instructions for "C" 
will help with the error.


On Fri, 24 May 2003 04:45:06 -0700
louise3@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

Of the 8 people currently subscribed to the droppings

You have used all of the 3 votes you are allotted 
for these choices. 
 

====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	droppings@xoko

with the subject, "C", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the droppings list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to droppings@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "C".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire droppings list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2 on choice 2 and 1 on choice 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 2
          3. 1

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your votes while the poll is open by voting again.


======== ==== ====
REMOVING YOUR VOTE

To remove your votes on "C", 
send the message:

To see the current vote tally on "C", 
send the message:

MORE INFORMATION
==== ===========

To receive more information about "C":

1.  Send a message to:

	droppings@xoko

2.  Your subject must be:

	C

3.  Your message should say:

	eVote help who

to learn details about the WHO command.

If your message says:

	eVote how Charlie@somewhere.com

you will receive a message reporting Charlie's vote.
To see your own vote, the current vote tally, and this
information again, send the command:

	eVote info

For a general explanation of eVote/Majordomo, use any 
subject line, and send the message:

	eVote help

Thank you for your unsubscribe message on the droppings list.

Unsubscribing from the list deletes your ballot and subtracts your
your influence from the statistics.

Is this really what you want to do?

At this time, the flow of messages has been stopped and your ballot
has been put on "vacation" which means that you can send an
"eVote back" message to the list to resume the flow of mail and your
ballot will be as you left it.

If you really want to leave forever, you need to verify that the
"unsubscribe" message really came from you.

To verify that your message really came from you, please confirm
this message by using "Reply-To".  You don't need to type anything
new in your confirmation message.  eVote will read your subject line
and your address; everything else will be ignored.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote y

Voting is closed on "A".

Perhaps the instructions for "A" 
will help.

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the droppings list

2.  Your subject must be:

3.  Your message should say:

	eVote help who

to learn details about the WHO command.

If your message says:

you will receive a message reporting Charlie's vote.
To see your own vote, the final vote tally, and this

Thank you for your unsubscribe message on the droppings list.

Unsubscribing from the list deletes your ballot and subtracts your
your influence from the statistics.

Is this really what you want to do?

At this time, the flow of messages has been stopped and your ballot
has been put on "vacation" which means that you can send an
"eVote back" message to the list to resume the flow of mail and your
ballot will be as you left it.

If you really want to leave forever, you need to verify that the
"unsubscribe" message really came from you.

To verify that your message really came from you, please confirm
this message by using "Reply-To".  You don't need to type anything
new in your confirmation message.  eVote will read your subject line
and your address; everything else will be ignored.

louise14@somewhere.com's last eVote participation: 
	Fri May 24 04:49:06 2003

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 3

Voting is closed on "B".

Perhaps the instructions for "B" 
will help.


On Fri, 24 May 2003 04:44:54 -0700
louise2@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	B

This poll was opened for voting on Fri, 24 May 2003 04:44:54 -0700
but has been closed since Fri, 24 May 2003 04:48:11 -0700

When this poll closed, there were 9 participants.
The participants of the droppings list were asked
to vote from 1 to 10.

1 subscriber to the droppings list voted.

====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	droppings@xoko

with the subject, "B", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the droppings list
can monitor your votes too.


==== ===========
