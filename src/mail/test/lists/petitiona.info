2.  Send a message to petitiona@deliberate.com with your subject.

---  cut  ---
eVote poll [y/n] public visible
message:

To Sign The Petition
== ==== === ========

2.  Make your subject be "Save the World" (really, the subject line of
    your poll).

3.  Have the message be your name, address, affiliation.

For The Petition Initiator
=== === ======== =========

You interact with your petition through the petitiona email list.  The
same commands are available to you on the petitiona list as are on any
other eVoted list.  This petitiona list has the extra facility that
"votes" can be cast (really, signatures are collected) when mail is
received by the eVote@deliberate.com address.  Any mail received
through that address will cause the message body to be appended to the
signature file for the particular petition.

Also, the petitiona list allows the retrieval of the signature file:

1.  Send a message to petitiona@deliberate.com

2.  Make the subject match the title of your petition

3.  In the message, say:

eVote names


If your original command was "eVote poll [y/n] public visible", as
above, anyone on this list can use the "eVote names" command
to retrieve the signatures for the petition.  If this is undesirable,
originate your petition with this command instead:

eVote poll [y/n] private visible

Then, only you can retrieve the signatures.


Vacation
========

eVote has a "vacation" feature.  If you want to stop the flow of
messages from this list (probably none anyway) but retain your
electronic ballot and your influence on the statistics, send this
message to petitiona@deliberate.com:

      eVote vacation

To see who is subscribed to the petitiona list, send this message to
petitiona@deliberate.com:

      eVote members

The list you receive will tell you which members are on vacation and
which email addresses on the list are archives, meaning they have no
eVoting privileges, which are simply signers to the petition.

eVote

This list is part of a beta test for the email version of eVote.

somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area.
