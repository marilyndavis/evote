Your mailing list has been established.  It is being served by eVote
and an automated mailing list manager that responds to commands
emailed to the "Majordomo address" listed above.  

This message has all the details of how to manage your list remotely
using Majordomo and eVote.  If you have any questions, refer them to
the Majordomo-Owner address listed above.

There's a lot of info here, so please read this completely and
carefully, and save it for future reference.  If you have any
questions, you should send them to the Majordomo-Owner address above.

Your list-owner password is shown above.  Keep track of this; you'll
need it later.  Instructions for changing your password are below.

As soon as possible, please issue a "newinfo" command for your list
(see below) to create the file that someone will receive when they
join or ask about your list.  Send the "info list-name" command first
to obtain a copy of the default information about eVote for your list.
You may want to include this information with your newinfo.

You can issue a "who" command for your list to see who's already on your
list.  You may or may not already be subscribed to your own list.

=======
Details
=======

Your mailing list is managed by an automated mailing list management
program called Majordomo.  Majordomo should free you from dealing
with most of the administrivia usually associated with running mailing
lists (adding users, dropping users, etc.).

To submit something to your list, you (or anybody else) should simply
mail it to the list posting address shown at the top of this file.

To be added to your list, a user simply sends a message of the form

    subscribe list-name

by email to the Majordomo address shown above.

Majordomo understands several commands, and is not limited to a
single command per message (it will process commands until reaching
end-of-message or the command "end").  The command "help" will tell
you about all the other commands.

Actually, it won't tell you about _all_ the other commands that 
Majordomo understands.  There are several commands there for use by
list owners such as yourself, which are not advertised to the public.
All of these commands are password-protected on a list-by-list basis,
but anyone with a valid list/password combination can invoke these
commands.  This is not exactly high-tech security, but it's more
intended to keep annoyance to a minimum rather than to be foolproof. 

The "documented" commands which Majordomo understands and which are
for everyone to use are:

    subscribe <list-name> [<address>]
    unsubscribe <list-name> [<address>]
    which [<address>]
    who <list-name>
    info <list-name>
    index <list-name>
    get <list-name>
    lists
    help
    end

You can get detailed explanations of all of these by asking for "help"
from Majordomo.

The "undocumented" commands for use by list owners are:

    approve <passwd> {subscribe|unsubscribe} <list-name> [<address>]

	This is so that you can approve subscription or unsubscription
	actions that need approval by the list owner.  Note that this
	is just a standard "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" command prefixed
	with "approve <password>" (where you substitute the password for
	your list, which is listed above, for "<password>").

    passwd <list-name> <old_passwd> <new_passwd>

	This is so you can change the password for your list, if you desire.

    newinfo <list-name> <password>

	This is so that you can replace the information file that people
	get when they do "info <list-name>" or "subscribe <list-name>".  It reads
	everything after the "newinfo" command to end-of-message or the
	word "EOF" on a line by itself as the new info for the list.

        Before sending in a new information file, use the "info list-name"
        command to take a look at the information file that already exists
        for list-name.  It contains some information about eVote that you 
        may want to include in your new information file.

    config <list-name> <password>

        retrieve a self-documenting configuration file for
        the list <list-name>.  The <password> can be the password
        contained in the file <listname>.passwd or the
        admin_password in the configuration file.

    newconfig <list-name> <password>

   	Validates and installs a new configuration file.  It reads
	everything after the "newconfig" command to end-of-message or
	the word "EOF" on a line by itself as the new info for the
	list.  The config file is expected to be a complete config
	file as returned by "config".  Incremental changing of the
	config file is not yet supported.  As soon as the config file
	is validated and installed its settings are available for
	use. This is useful to remember if you have multiple commands
	in your mail message since they will be subject to the
	settings of the new config file.  If there is an error in the
	config file (incorrect value...), the config file will not be
	accepted and the error message identifying the problem line(s)
	will be returned to the sender.  Note that only the error
	messages are returned to the sender not the entire config
	file, so it would be a good idea to keep a copy of your
	outgoing email message.


    writeconfig <list-name> <password> 

        Write a new config file in standard form. Writeconfig forces a
	rewrite of the config file with all comments and default
	values in place. It is useful to use after an upgrade of
	majordomo since it will add the new keywords for people to
	change. It also updates the documentation in the file if that
	has changed.

Mailer Errors
====== ======

When an email address on your list stops working, you'll receive an
error message every time a message is posted to your list.  To remove
the bad address, send directly to your list, i.e., to:

list-name@yourdomain.com

and say

eVote approve <password> bounce <bad_email_address> <another_bad_address> ..

Use the same password as you use for majordomo commands.

The addresses will be removed from your list and will be placed on a
special "bounces" list.  You should have a cron task that runs
majordomo's bounce-remind script every day.  It sends the bounces list
a message advising the recipients that their address has been bad and
giving instructions on how to reinstate their subscription.

NOTE:  Don't unsubscribe bad addresses and don't use Majordomo's
bounce command:

    1.  You'll destroy the user's ballot.

If you only unsubscribe the address:

    2.  The user won't know that she's been unsubscribed.


eVote Commands
===== ========

You can use the same password for the following eVote commands.  Send
these commands directly to your list's address:
list-name@yourdomain.com

The subject line should refer to an established poll for these
commands:

    eVote approve <password> close

        closes the established poll.  Notice is sent to all
        subscribers that you have forced the closing of the poll.

    eVote approve <password> drop

        drops the poll from the database.  Notice is sent to all
        subscribers.

    eVote approve <password> drop silent

        drops the poll from the database.  No notice is sent to
        the subscribers.

For the following commands the subject line is irrelevant.  Once
again, these commands should be sent to the list address.

    eVote approve <password> back <address>

        places the <address> on majordomo's list and reactivates the
        ballot.  If the address is on Majordomo's "bounces" list,
        it is removed.  You can only bring back one address per
        message.  You can say:

        eVote approve <password> back <address> "something more"

        and "something" more will be in majordomo's list on the
        same line with the email address.

    eVote approve <password> bounce <address>

        removes the <address> from majordomo's list while retaining
        the ballot.  The address can NOT modify its ballot while
        in this state.  The bounced address is also added to
        Majordomo's "bounces" list and will be sent a nightly
        notice that the address has been failing.  You can bounce
        many addresses in the same message:

        eVote approve <password> bounce <address1> <address2> ...

    eVote approve <password> move <old-address> <new-address>

        moves the address while it retains the ballot.  This command
        moves the address for all lists run at this site.

    eVote approve <password> no-vote <address>

        changes the <address> to a non-voter.  This is useful for
        archive addresses.

    eVote approve <password> vacation <address>

        removes the <address> from majordomo's list while retaining
        the ballot.  The address can NOT modify its ballot while
        in this state.

    eVote approve <password> vote <address>

        changes the <address> to a voter again.

    eVote approve <password> vote_only <address>

        removes the <address> from majordomo's list while retaining
        the ballot.  The address CAN modify its ballot while in this
        state.


Info File
==== ====

The info files for your list should be changed so that it announces to
list members that the list is eVoted.  The info file might look like:

---     Sample info file  ---

[A description of your list's purpose goes here]

eVote
=====

Most messages that are sent to the address list-name@eVoted-site.net
will be forwarded to all the members of the list.  However, if your
message starts with the word "eVote", instead, it will be processed by
eVote.

Because this list is eVoted, anyone on this list can generate a poll
for the list members to vote on.

To see what polls are open for this list, send the message:

     eVote list

to list-name@eVoted-site.net.


To learn more about eVote, send the message:

     eVote help

to list-name@eVoted-site.net.


Vacation
========

eVote has a "vacation" feature.  If you want to stop the flow of
messages but retain your electronic ballot and your influence on
the statistics, send this message to list-name@eVoted-site.net:

      eVote vacation


Moving
======

If you move your email address, notify
owner-list-name@eVoted-site.net.  The owner can move your address
and preserve your ballot.

If you belong to several eVoted lists at this site, you only need to
notify one list owner of your move.  eVote will move your address for
all lists and notify all your lists' owners.

Members
=======

To see who is subscribed to the list-name list, send this message
to list-name@eVoted-site.net:

      eVote members

The list you receive will tell you which members are on vacation and
which email addresses on the list are archives, meaning they have no
eVoting privileges.


Bugs
====

If you find a bug, please report it to eVote-users@deliberate.com. 

--- end of sample info file ---

Configuring Your List
=====================

You should retrieve the configuration file for your list. To do this,
send an email message to the majordomo address listed at the top of
this form. The contents of this message should be:

	config <List name> <List password>

Where <ListName> <List password> are given at the top of the form. You
will receive a config file that can be used to change the operation of
your list. 

The configuration file is meant to be self documenting. Once you have
completed all of the changes to the config file, You should use the
newconfig command (described above) to put a new configuration file in
place.

Approval
========

When Majordomo requests your approval for something, it sends you a
message that includes a template of the approval message; if you concur,
you simply need to replace "PASSWORD" in the template with your list
password, and send the template line back to Majordomo.

The requests for approval that Majordomo generates all start with
"APPROVE" in the "Subject:" line.  

You aren't limited to approving only things to Majordomo requests
approval for.  You can approve any "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" request,
regardless of whether Majordomo has requested this approval, with an
"approve" command.  Thus, you can subscribe or unsubscribe people from
your list without them having to send anything to Majordomo; just
send an appropriate "approve PASSWORD subscribe LIST ADDRESS" or
"approve PASSWORD unsubscribe LIST ADDRESS" command off to Majordomo.

If you read your mail on a UNIX system and have "perl" available (try
"perl -v" and see if it tells you about perl; if it gives you a
"command not found" message instead, then you don't have perl on your
machine), there is a program called "approve" available to automate the
approval process; contact your Majordomo-Owner at the address listed
above for a copy of the program.

Bounced Messages
================

Majordomo may bounce certain messages that people attempt to post to your
mailing list.  These messages may be bounced because they appear to be
administrative requests (i.e., someone mailed a request to subscribe or
unsubscribe to the posting address rather than to Majordomo or to the
-request address), because they are too long, because they match strings
that you or the list server owner has defined as being "taboo", or for any
of a number of other reasons, many of which may seem annoying but have been
decided upon as being useful in stopping unwanted messages from making it
onto your list.  (These are often configurable, so if you find a check to
be too restrictive you can generally turn it off.)  Note also that the
bounces mentioned here are not the same as the errors that will be returned
by various mail servers when addresses or hosts are unreachable.  Those are
generally referred to as bounces, also; sorry for the confusion.

Majordomo will forward these messages to you in another message whose
subject line begins with the word "BOUNCE"; the subject line will also
indicate the name of the list the message was bounced from (in case you
manage more than one list) and the reason the message was bounced.

If you decide that the message is OK and should not have been bounced, then
you can cause Majordomo to post it anyway by sending the message back to
the posting address (NOT to the Majordomo address) with a special
"Approved: password" header.  There are two ways to do this; the method you
use depends on your having access to and the ability to run the approve
script mentioned in the previous section.  If you can run approve it is
recommended that you do so, as this method is much less prone to errors and
will reduce the time you spend moderating your list.

If you cannot run the approve script, you can manually approve the
message.  To do so, follow the following directions _exactly_:

    1)  Save the original message (the body of the message you received
	from Majordomo) in a file.  The portion you need will consist of
        the headers of the original message, followed by a single blank
        line, followed by the text of the original message.  You do not
        need to include any of the headers of the message which contained
        the original message.  Here's a quick example:

From: majordomo@list.server         \
To: your-list-approval@list.server  | Don't want these headers
Subject: BOUNCE: taboo_header found /
                                    - Blank line
>From list-member@her.site  date    \ 
Received: some long routing info    | Headers of original message;
From: list-member@her.site          | You want these.  It's OK if you
To: your-list@list.server           | don't have the first line.
Subject: Just a message             /
                                    - Blank line, you _must_ have this!
Hello.  I'm just writing to         \
consume some bandwidth and          | Message body; include all of
take up space in your mail          | this.
spool!                              /

        Basically you want everything after (and not including) the first
        blank line.

    2)  Edit the file to insert a line that says "Approved: password" (where
	"password" is the password for your list) at the top, before the
	original message, with absolutely no intervening space:

Approved: sekrit
>From list-member@her.site  date
Received: some long routing info
From: list-member@her.site
To: your-list@list.server
Subject: Just a message

Hello.  I'm just writing to
consume some bandwidth and
take up space in your mail
spool!

    3)  Send this edited file back to the posting address for your list (NOT
	to Majordomo).  You should make sure that your mailer doesn't try
        to do anything like include your prepared mail as an attachment,
        encode it somehow, indent every line, or add anything extra to the
        beginning or end of the message.  There are mailers that will do
        pretty horrible things to messages before they are sent; you should
        take care that you aren't using one or, if you are, you have it
        configured to pass your text on unadulterated.

This time around, Majordomo will notice the "Approved:" line and check it
against your list password.  If it matches, Majordomo will strip off the
header of your message and the "Approved:" line (leaving just the original
message), and send the original message on through.

Even your own messages bay be bounced to you for approval.  To send out your
own message without server checks (perhaps you know it contains something
the list server will complain about) you can pre-approve the message one of
the two following ways:

If you're using a mailer that can add additional headers, add one like the
following:

Approved: sekrit

It's precise location within the headers is not important.

If your mailer does not allow you to add additional headers, you can add
the line:

Approved: sekrit

as the first line of the message, followed by a blank line (which is
required for your message to be sent properly) followed by the text of your
message.  The Approved: line and one following blank line will be deleted
and the message will be passed without being checked.  The blank line is
important because it is used to differentiate between a pre-approval and the
approval of a bounced message, outlined above.


Moderation
==========

If your list is moderated, (the moderate parameter in the config
file is yes) then messages without an "Approved:" line are bounced,
just as described above.  To cause them to be posted to the list, you
add a valid "Approved:" line and send them back, just as described
above.

Again, the "approve" program automates all this if you wish to use it.  You
can also use the above pre-approval method to send your own messages
without them being bounced back to you.

If you have any questions about all of this, send them to the Majordomo-Owner
address shown at the top of this file.


Restricting Posting
===================

An easier alternative to moderation is to restrict who can post to the
list, which can be done with the restrict_post configuration variable.
The variable requires a file listing the people who can post.

The most common case is to limit posting to people who are subscribed
to the list.  This keeps out advertisements and other junk mail sent
by non-subscribers.  Since majordomo already has a file of subscribers,
you don't need to create and maintain a file, so it's easy to set.

Change the restrict_post line to this, where <listname> is the name of
your list:

restrict_post = <listname>

If you want to restrict posting to any other set of people, you'll
need to ask majordomo-owner for help.  Unfortunately there's no way to
tell majordomo about keeping another file of people who are allowed to
post, so a file would have to be set in place "by hand".  Some future
release of majordomo may provide a way to do this automatically.


Archive
=======

Archiving has to be set or unset by the system administrators reached
at majordomo-owner@FooBar.COM.  It is not the default but must be
requested.  Here is what can be done.

Archive files can be split by years, months, or days.  This means all
mail to the list for one of those periods of time will be collected
into one archive file.  People who want to get archived mail will need
to get one such file as a unit.

We are running an indexer program nightly.  It produces two index files
that subscribers can get: CONTENTS lists what subject lines are in each
archive file; TOPICS lists what archive files contain each subject.

Subscribers use the "get" command to see files in the archives.  Examples:
  get ListName CONTENTS            # gets the CONTENTS file
  get ListName ListName.9507       # gets the July 1995 archive file

Access to archives is controlled by the get_access variable in the
config file.  The default "list" means they must be subscribers to get 
archived files.

Subscribers can also get a list of filenames and dates in the archive
by sending an "index" command.  Example:
  index ListName

This is controlled by the config file variable index_access similarly.

Notes on archiving.

 -  It's possible for the archive to contain files besides the indexes
    and the archive files of messages.  However, majordomo offers no
    method for you to put them there.  In an unusual case you can ask 
    majordomo-owner to put a file there for you.  

 -  Archiving could be accomplished by directing a copy of messages to
    some other place besides the majordomo archive.  Ask, if you have
    something in mind.

Digest
=======

A digest version of a list is a way to reduce the number of messages sent
from Majordomo to subscribers.  Normally, each message to the list is
remailed to all the subscribers, but with a digest, several messages are
collected into a batch and then sent together as one message.  This does
not reduce the total size too much, although there are fewer mail header
lines-- the main purpose is to reduce the number of separate messages.
This actually helps the mail systems at both ends, and may help subscribers
reduce clutter in their mailboxes.

A Majordomo digest is actually a separate mailing list.  The digest of
ListName would normally be called ListName-digest.

People subscribe independently to ListName and ListName-digest.  
Very likely no one would want to be on both lists.  To change between 
ListName and ListName-digest, a subscriber needs to unsubscribe
from one list and subscribe to the other.  This can be done with one
message to majordomo@FooBar.COM with two command lines in it, e.g.:
  unsubscribe ListName
  subscribe ListName-digest

Remember that ListName-digest will have its own information file and
configuration file.  Change them, if you want to, when you change the
same files for ListName.

Majordomo will send a digest automatically when the size of the digest
exceeds the size given as max_length in the configuration file of the
digest list.  The default max_length is 40 K.  Thus the interval
between digests can vary, but they will be of a predictable size.

The listowner can also tell Majordomo to make a digest (meaning, compile
and send out a digest) by sending the command mkdigest at any time:
  mkdigest ListName-digest password

A daily digest (or for some other time period) could be achieved by
setting the max_length high enough so as not to be reached normally in
a day, and then setting up a job to run daily that sends mail to
Majordomo with the mkdigest command.  On a unix system, give the
commands "man crontab" and "man 5 crontab" at the shell for an
explanation of such jobs, or ask majordomo-owner for help.
