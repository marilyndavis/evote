[A description of your list's purpose goes here]

Most messages that are sent to the address list-name@eVoted-site.net
will be forwarded to all the members of the list.  However, if your
message starts with the word "eVote", instead, it will be processed by
eVote.

Because this list is eVoted, anyone on this list can generate a poll
for the list members to vote on.

To see what polls are open for this list, send the message:

     eVote list

to list-name@eVoted-site.net.


To learn more about eVote, send the message:

     eVote help

Vacation
========

eVote has a "vacation" feature.  If you want to stop the flow of
messages but retain your electronic ballot and your influence on
the statistics, send this message to list-name@eVoted-site.net:

      eVote vacation


Moving
======

If you move your email address, notify
owner-list-name@eVoted-site.net.  The owner can move your address
and preserve your ballot.

If you belong to several eVoted lists at this site, you only need to
notify one list owner of your move.  eVote will move your address for
all lists and notify all your lists' owners.

Members
=======

To see who is subscribed to the eVote_sample list, send this message
to list-name@eVoted-site.net:

      eVote members

The list you receive will tell you which members are on vacation and
which email addresses on the list are archives, meaning they have no
eVoting privileges.

End
===

If you have a signature on your message, add a line with "end" when
you communicate with eVote.

Bugs
====

If you  find a bug, please report it to eVote-users@deliberate.com.
