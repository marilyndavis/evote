# The configuration file for a majordomo mailing list.
# Comments start with the first # on a line, and continue to the end
# of the line. There is no way to escape the # character. The file
# uses either a key = value for simple (i.e. a single) values, or uses
# a here document
#     key << END 
#     value 1
#     value 2
#     [ more values 1 per line]
#     END 
# for installing multiple values in array types. Note that the here
# document delimiter (END in the example above) must be the same at the end
# of the list of entries as it is after the << characters.
# Within a here document, the # sign is NOT a comment character.
# A blank line is allowed only as the last line in the here document.
#
# The values can have multiple forms:
#
#	absolute_dir -- A root anchored (i.e begins with a /) directory 
#	absolute_file -- A root anchored (i.e begins with a /) file 
#	bool -- choose from: yes, no, y, n
#	enum -- One of a list of possible values
#	integer -- an integer (string made up of the digits 0-9,
#		   no decimal point)
#	float -- a floating point number with decimal point.
#	regexp -- A perl style regular expression with
# 		  leading and trailing /'s.
#	restrict_post -- a series of space or : separated file names in which
#                        to look up the senders address
#	            (restrict-post should go away to be replaced by an
#		     array of files)
#	string -- any text up until a \n stripped of
#		  leading and trailing whitespace
#	word -- any text with no embedded whitespace
#
# A blank value is also accepted, and will undefine the corresponding keyword.
# The character Control-A may not be used in the file.
#
# A trailing _array on any of the above types means that that keyword
# will allow more than one value.
#
# Within a here document for a string_array, the '-' sign takes on a special
# significance.
#
#     To embed a blank line in the here document, put a '-' as the first
#       and ONLY character on the line.
#
#     To preserve whitespace at the beginning of a line, put a - on the
#       line before the whitespace to be preserved
#
#     To put a literal '-' at the beginning of a line, double it.
#
#
# The default if the keyword is not supplied is given in ()'s while the 
# type of value is given in [], the subsystem the keyword is used in is
# listed in <>'s. (undef) as default value means that the keyword is not
# defined or used.
