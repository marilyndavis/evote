INTERNET ACTION GROUP
======== ====== =====


The Internet Action Group is an organization dedicated to bringing
information about the Internet to the streets and the public. We
organize small, localized demonstrations worldwide to protest
censorship of the 'net, and focus on getting facts to the offline
public. 


Our Process/Our Organization
=== =========== ============

Our democratic process for organizing ourselves and the demonstrations
occurs entirely online on an email list that has new software for
polling ourselves, eVote.  

This document, and all the documentation that follows has been
developed by the subscribers of the email list by loosely using the
following procedure.

1.  Someone makes a suggestion.

2.  If no one objects, someone, usually the same someone, implements
that suggestion, (or the suggestion is discussed/forgotten).

3.  The implementation is presented.

4.  We work collaboratively online to improve the implementation.

At any point a poll can be taken to make a decision on a detail if
there is a difference of opinion.

When the when the collaboratively developed document settles down,
there is a final poll.  The document must be accepted by a 3:1
majority for it to become part of our literature.

The list which IAG uses to keep all of its members connected is
unmoderated.  Also, you may share in the "owner"-ship of the list.
We'll explain how later.

In addition to bringing the cause of cyber-rights to the streets, we
are trying to set an example for self-motivating, supermajority-
governed communities.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE IAG EMAIL LIST
=========== ===== === === ===== ====

The purpose of this open and unmoderated list is to organize
simultaneous local non-violent demonstrations at coordinated sites
around the world in response to local and national attacks on the
internet.

This action group is directed in its actions by democratic process.
The definition of the new democratic online process for group
involvement is in embryonic stages.  As starters, this group's process
will attempt emulation of *some* of the characteristics of the
decision-making process of the Livermore Action Group and others that
make their decisions by consensus.

In face-to-face consensus-run meetings, a proposal is discussed, there
is a show of hands, more discussion, another show of hands, ... ,
until there is agreement.  If there are only a few dissenters, these
dissenters are required to state their objections, and another poll is
taken.

Online we emulate the process by holding a poll open while discussion
progresses.  People can change their votes continuously and anytime
anyone can query eVote for the current list of votes.

However, online, rather than demand complete agreement, a 3:1
agreement is sufficient to carry a proposal.

Except for the election of the list's "owner" and any other elections
that might become necessary, all polls on this list will be "public"
meaning that we can see each other's votes.

Anyone deemed disruptive to online cooperative process, or not aligned
with our stated purpose, by a 3:1 vote of the list's voters, will lose
his/her posting privileges for one month.

This list, iag@deliberate.com list, begun on June 14, 1996, is
archived by Majordomo at deliberate.com and by Pangaea.  You can
access Pangaea's archives from http://www.Reference.com.

This list is part of a beta test for the email version of eVote.

If you find a bug, no matter how trivial, please report the bug to the
"bugs" list at deliberate.com.  A first report of a particular bug
wins the reporter 2 tickets to eVote's New Millenium's Eve Party on
December 31, 1999, somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Most messages that are sent to the address "iag@deliberate.com" will be
forwarded to all the members of the list.  However, if your message
starts with the word "eVote", instead, it will be processed by eVote.

Because this list is eVoted, anyone on this list can generate a poll
for the list members to vote on.

To see what polls are open for this list, send the message:

     eVote list

to iag@deliberate.com.

Vacation
========

eVote has a "vacation" feature.  If you want to stop the flow of
messages but retain your electronic ballot and your influence on
the statistics, send this message to iag@deliberate.com:

     eVote vacation

To see who is subscribed to the iag list, send this message to
iag@deliberate.com:

     eVote members

The list you receive will tell you which members are on vacation
and which are email addresses on the list are archives, meaning
they have no eVoting privileges.

To learn more about eVote, send the message:

     eVote help

to iag@deliberate.com.

OUR PLAN
=== ====

The Internet Action Group Plan

Our purpose is to awaken public awareness to the global democratic
potential of the internet and the need to protect it from government
attack.

Toward that purpose, we are organizing simultaneous local non-violent
demonstrations at coordinated sites around the world in response to
local and national attacks on the internet.

The IAG plan for a local action is small: everyone find somewhere
officious to carry a sign and sing a song at some specified time and
date.  We will organize various gathering places around the world for
people who wish to gather with others and sing in a group.

To be an official organizer:

1.  Register your name, email address and general location with us
so that others can find you and your demonstration.    

2.  Call your local police to be sure that a demonstration without
a loudspeaker does not require a permit -- that's how it is in San
Francisco.

3.  Follow steps 2-5 for participants, as follows.

To participate:

1.  Check with us for a gathering site near you.

2.  Send email to your local organizer to thank him/her for setting
up a demonstration - or become an organizer yourself.

3.  Make a sign to carry.

4.  Print out 10-100 copies of our pamphlet and song lyrics.

5.  Show up and sing.


COLLABORATIVE STEPS TO GET THERE FROM HERE

The Internet Action Group's email list will collaborate online to
produce materials and decisions in support of the demonstrations.
Tasks 2 through 8 can be handled simultaneously.  All 8 steps will
be finished before attempting step 9: deciding on the targets.  This
is so that our demonstrations can be responsive to the most current
situation.

1.  Formally adopt some derivative of this plan.

>>>  A.  Post the Official Plan to our Web Site

2.  Compose a pamphlet to hand out in the streets: who we are, what we
want, a list of countries and states that have offended us.  Probably
we can copy http://www/cs/cmu.edu/~declan/international and
http://www.teleport.com/~richieb/state for offending governments.

>>>  B.  Post the IAG Pamplet to our Web Site

3.  Make an organizer's guide for anyone willing to take
responsibility for a local demonstration.  This will be the above list
of *must do's* and optional activities for our organizers.  Optional
activities might include:

 * Get in touch with community networks and other local online groups.
   Email the Call to Action (below).

 * Get in touch with your local peace/environment/etc groups.  Plug
   your action into their calendars.

 * Leaflet with information about the upcoming action at local computer
   stores, computer book stores, high-tech companies, schools, etc.

 * Make extra signs for others to carry.

 * Set up a bigger demonstration with a permit, a public address system
   and a band.

>>> C.   Post the IAG Organizer's Guide to our Web Site

4.  Gather a list of committed organizers and identify each organizer
with his/her area.  This will be our Local Action List.

>>> D.   Post the IAG Local Action List to our Web Site

5.  Make a list of related email lists and newsgroups and find a
volunteer for each list that will stand ready to take our Call to
Action to each forum.  This will be our Related Forum List.

6.  Decide on an official song to sing at the demonstrations.  Decide
the key for anyone who wants to bring an instrument.  Everyone who has
a song idea should put in a [-10,10] poll with their song lyrics as
the poll text.  The subject can start with SONG: to give us a sorting
key for the results.

>>> E.   Post our first IAG song to our Web Site

7.  Draft our first Call To Action.  This is the small announcement
that we broadcast across the net.  At this point the exact targets and
date will be unknown.

8.  Decide how much time we need to publicize our action before it
happens.  This can be a poll with limits from [1,100] days.

9.  Decide on our targets.  Unless something more interesting comes
along, I suggest that our first priority targets be French Consulates,
but we should vote when we get our ducks lined up.  If there isn't a
primary target near you, then take the secondary targets.  We should
also vote on whether the secondary targets should be city, county,
state or federal offices, or something more creative?  These decisions
might take a series of votes.

10.  Finalize our Call To Action.

>>> F.   Post our Call To Action to our Web Site

11.  Broadcast our Call to Action to the Related Forum List.

12.  Show up and sing.

December 4, 1996

The list has been pretty quite for a few months.  But it keeps
growing.  We just topped 100.

We are waiting for two more volunteers to organize demonstrations in
their corners of the world.  I'll generate one in the SF Bay Area.

You can demonstrate your support for the ideas here by voting on
the above documents.  

After you join, write to iag@deliberate.com, the message should say:

    eVote info

your subject can be:

"A Plan"           - to learn how to vote on the above plan.

or

"Pamphlet Text"    - to learn how to vote on the text above.

Send a message to majordomo@deliberate.com and have the message say

help

to learn how to retrieve the archives for this list.

The IAG could use a new web-person for the group.  Perhaps you'd would
like the job?
