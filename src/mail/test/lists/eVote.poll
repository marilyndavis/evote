Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
\list@\whereami.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to \list@\whereami.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
\list@\whereami.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to \list@\whereami:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the \list email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific

                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have

                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

Signature File?
========= =====

If you attach a signature to your email messages, please add a line
that says "end" to your eVote commands.
