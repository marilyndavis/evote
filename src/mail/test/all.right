eVote Information
===== ===========

The list-serving facility at xoko has "eVote" attached.  This
means that members of the abc list can poll each other.  Many
different types of polls are possible.

All messages that pertain to voting/polling *must* start with the
word, "eVote".  If you forget this, your message will be sent to the
entire abc list and it will not be processed by eVote.  So 
please be careful.

To learn how to set up a poll, or simply to understand eVote better,
send email to abc@xoko.  The subject line doesn't 
matter.  The message should say:

     eVote help poll

To receive a list of all the subjects for the abc list  
with polls attached, your message to abc@xoko 
should say:

    eVote list

You can use "eVote list open" to see which subjects have polls that
are open for voting.  "eVote list closed" will list the closed polls.

More information is available on a poll by poll basis.  To get 
information about the poll attached to the subject, "Favorite Movie",
send email to abc@xoko with "Favorite Movie" as the 
subject.  Your message can say:

eVote info        To learn how to participate in the poll, to see
                  your vote on this poll, and to see the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote stats       To see your vote on this poll and the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote who help    To learn how to query eVote with who-voted questions:
	          "Who voted yes?", "Who voted 10?", ...  whatever
                  makes sense for the particular poll.  This feature
                  is not available for all polls.
               
eVote how help    To learn how to query eVote for how a particular
                  subscriber voted, if this information is available.

Be aware that polls are identified by the first 36 characters of the
subject line of the message and case doesn't matter.  For example, if
someone on the abc list initiates a poll by sending an 
"eVote poll" command to abc@xoko with the subject, 
"Favorite Movie", all subsequent messages with the subject, "Favorite
Movie", or even "Re: FAVORITE MOVIE" and "Re:RE:favorite movie", and
with "eVote" as the first word of the message will be processed by
eVote as belonging to the established poll.  If "eVote" is not the
first word. The message is assumed to be part of the discussion about
"Favorite Movie" and it is distributed to all the members of the 
abc list.

Vacation
========

If you go on vacation, send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote vacation

eVote will stop the flow of messages but will keep your ballot for
you.  If you unsubscribe your ballot will be dropped as well as your
influence on the statistics.


Moving
======

If you move your email address, notify your list's owner.  Your owner
can move your address and preserve your ballot.

If you belong to several eVoted lists at xoko, you only need to
notify one list owner of your move.  eVote will move your address for
all lists and notify all your lists' owners.


Members
=======

To receive a list of eVote's notion of the members of the abc list,
send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote members

The list you receive will tell you who is on vacation and which 
members are really archive addresses without eVoting privileges.

End
===

If you attach a signature to your email messages, end your eVote
commands with a line that says "end".

Bugs
====

If you find a bug, pleas report it to eVote-users@deliberate.com.
This is an email list which you are welcome to join.

In response to your message:

eVote poll

----

There's not enough information in your message to establish a poll.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant

                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.

In response to your message:

eVote poll  3

----

eVote cannot understand the word, "3".
Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

In response to your message:

eVote poll public hidden

----

eVote can't determine the minimum and maximum votes for your poll.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

In response to your message:

eVote poll [y/n] hidden

----

eVote can't determine if the poll is "public", "private", or "if-voted".

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric

	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in

                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have

                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

In response to your message:

eVote poll [y/n] public

----

eVote can't determine if the tally should be VISIBLE or HIDDEN while the 
poll is open.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to

    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant

In response to your message:

eVote poll abc

----

eVote cannot understand the word, "abc".
Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

In response to your message:

eVote help

----

eVote Information
===== ===========

The list-serving facility at xoko has "eVote" attached.  This
means that members of the abc list can poll each other.  Many
different types of polls are possible.

All messages that pertain to voting/polling *must* start with the
word, "eVote".  If you forget this, your message will be sent to the
entire abc list and it will not be processed by eVote.  So 
please be careful.

To learn how to set up a poll, or simply to understand eVote better,
send email to abc@xoko.  The subject line doesn't 
matter.  The message should say:

     eVote help poll

To receive a list of all the subjects for the abc list  
with polls attached, your message to abc@xoko 
should say:

    eVote list

You can use "eVote list open" to see which subjects have polls that
are open for voting.  "eVote list closed" will list the closed polls.

More information is available on a poll by poll basis.  To get 
information about the poll attached to the subject, "Favorite Movie",
send email to abc@xoko with "Favorite Movie" as the 
subject.  Your message can say:

eVote info        To learn how to participate in the poll, to see
                  your vote on this poll, and to see the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote stats       To see your vote on this poll and the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote who help    To learn how to query eVote with who-voted questions:
	          "Who voted yes?", "Who voted 10?", ...  whatever
                  makes sense for the particular poll.  This feature
                  is not available for all polls.
               
eVote how help    To learn how to query eVote for how a particular
                  subscriber voted, if this information is available.

Be aware that polls are identified by the first 36 characters of the
subject line of the message and case doesn't matter.  For example, if
someone on the abc list initiates a poll by sending an 
"eVote poll" command to abc@xoko with the subject, 
"Favorite Movie", all subsequent messages with the subject, "Favorite
Movie", or even "Re: FAVORITE MOVIE" and "Re:RE:favorite movie", and
with "eVote" as the first word of the message will be processed by
eVote as belonging to the established poll.  If "eVote" is not the
first word. The message is assumed to be part of the discussion about
"Favorite Movie" and it is distributed to all the members of the 
abc list.

Vacation
========

If you go on vacation, send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote vacation

eVote will stop the flow of messages but will keep your ballot for
you.  If you unsubscribe your ballot will be dropped as well as your
influence on the statistics.


Moving
======

If you move your email address, notify your list's owner.  Your owner
can move your address and preserve your ballot.

If you belong to several eVoted lists at xoko, you only need to
notify one list owner of your move.  eVote will move your address for
all lists and notify all your lists' owners.


Members
=======

To receive a list of eVote's notion of the members of the abc list,
send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote members

The list you receive will tell you who is on vacation and which 
members are really archive addresses without eVoting privileges.

End
===

If you attach a signature to your email messages, end your eVote
commands with a line that says "end".

Bugs
====

If you find a bug, pleas report it to eVote-users@deliberate.com.
This is an email list which you are welcome to join.

Dear mary@somewhere.com, 

Thank you for initializing a poll/petition.  And thank you for
checking the results of your command before sending to the 
abc list.  Here's what the abc community would have
received if you didn't say "check".

       be counted!

          eVote 5

       Your vote can be any number from -10 to 10.

       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

In response to your message:

eVote poll public visible check

----

eVote can't determine the minimum and maximum votes for your poll.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

If you attach a signature to your email messages, please add a line

In response to your message:

2. or another choice
message:

----

eVote can't determine the vote limits for all the choices in your poll.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other

IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll [y/n] if-voted visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

In response to your message:

eVote poll [-1,120]

----

The maximum vote must be 119 or less.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

In response to your message:

eVote poll [10] public visible

----

eVote can't determine the minimum and maximum votes for your poll.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in

                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific

                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote

                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you

                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.

In response to your message:

eVote poll [1,-10]

----

The minimum vote must be less than the maximum vote.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

In response to your message:

eVote poll [-120,100]

----

The minimum vote must be -119 or more.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /

  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |

  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:

    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

In response to your message:

eVote poll group public visible 
message:

----

We need some choices to vote on!

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"

    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====

                                your "eVote list" command is

In response to your message:

eVote poll group public visible 3
1. one choice  [y/n]
2. another choice [y/n]
message:

----

Voters have more yeses to distribute than there are choices. 
This doesn't make sense.
Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

14 participants are asked to vote YES on 2 of the following choices:

  Your  Yes    No     On      
  Vote  Votes  Votes  Choice  

    -    0      0     1. one choice

You have used 0 of your 2 YES votes.


====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "Exactly the number of choices", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "Exactly the number of choices".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote yes on choices 1 and 2, your message should say:

          eVote 
          1. y
          2. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

In response to your message:

eVote poll group public visible 1
1. one choice [y/n]
message:

----

We need more choices than one!

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"
command to remind themselves of the subject line.

Note that eVote only recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject 
line and truncates the rest.

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /
  o    *        \        /
  o    *          \    /
  o    *            \/_  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  
  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |
  o                                                                 |
  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |
     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|
    |
    |   You concoct other types of votes by choosing other words
    |   for the last three spots in your "eVote poll" command:
    |
    |    [y/n]              public                 visible
    |      or                 or                     or
    |    [1,10]             private                hidden
    |      or                 or                       
    |    [3,74]             if-voted               Can we see 
    |                                              the tally as 
    |    Give the vote      Say "public" if        it develops?
    |    limits in [ ]      you want a show
    |    first.  119 is     of hands, that 
    |    the highest        is, list members can query eVote to
    |    vote possible;     see other members' votes.  Say "private"
    |    -119, the lowest.  to take a secret vote; "if-voted", if
    |    [y/n] means a      participants can see *if* others voted,
    |    yes or no vote.    but not *how*.
    |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|


Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

In response to your message:

1. one choice [1,10]
2. another choice [5,10]
message:

----

The sum of the minimum votes on your choices, 6, 
equals the number of votes each voter is allowed.  This doesn't leave 
any decision for the list members to make.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:

Taking A Poll With eVote
====== = ==== ==== =====

You can send a message to this list's regular address to set up a new
poll for the your email list.  The list address is 
abc@xoko.

The Subject Line
=== ======= ====

Choose the subject of your poll carefully.  Keep it short and logical
so that people can remember it.  To vote, or to communicate with eVote
about your poll, people must either remember the subject line, or
reply-to a message with the subject line, or send an "eVote list"

The subject of your poll will be the subject line of your message.
Choose it carefully.  Keep it short and easy to spell.  eVote only
recognizes the first 36 characters of your subject line.

Polling on a particular subject does not interfere with the regular
messages sent and distributed to the list on that subject. 


POLL TYPES
==== =====

There are many types of polls available.  Each poll is:

          a single question or a multiple choice
                           and
                     yes/no or numeric
                           and 
                     public or private or if-voted
	                   and
                    visible or hidden

For example, send the following line to take a yes-or-no vote, where
the participants can see others' votes, and where the vote tally is
visible to all as the vote develops:

eVote poll [y/n] public visible
  o    *    \                /
  o    *      \            /

  o    *                                                            |
  o    * * * "poll" is the command to set up a new poll.            |

  o o  Be sure that "eVote" is the first word in your message!      |
       Otherwise your command will be sent to the whole list        |
       and it will be ignored by eVote.                             |
                                                                    |

Checking
========

To test your poll command, add the word "check":
                                         =====
eVote poll [1,10] private hidden check

In this case, eVote will pretend to process your command.  No poll
will be generated.  The voting instructions will be sent only to you
for checking.

If you like the instructions, remove the "check" from your command,
resend it, and the poll is open for business.

A Message
= =======

After you give the complete "eVote poll" command, you can follow it
with some text that explains the poll.  eVote will send voting
instructions and your message to all the members of the 
list.

Also your message will appear in the response when a participant
sends an "eVote info" command.

To include a message, precede your message with the word, "message:".

Example
-------

Here's an example for a poll attached to the subject, "Rate the Mayor":

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll [1,10] public visible
message:
If you think our mayor is doing an outstanding job, vote 10.
If you think the mayor is doing a poor job, vote 1.
Or vote somewhere in between.

Note that this is a public poll so we can all see how everyone voted.
Please support your vote with a message to the list explaining your
opinion.

--------   end of message ------------

This message will generate instructions for the poll and send them,
along with your message, to the list.  Again, if you wish, add 
the word "check" to the "eVote poll" command to be sure there are
no mistakes.

Fancier Vote Types
------- ---- -----

If you want the list members to choose one of four options, 
send this message to abc@xoko.  The subject line
might be "Chocolate Choices".

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?

--------   end of message ------------

For a list of choices like this one, there are four words beyond 
the "eVote poll" part of the command:

     "group"    comes first - indicating that there are a 
                list of choices.

     "public"   can be "private" or "if-voted" if you prefer.

     "visible"  or "hidden", if you don't want the tally to be
                accessible until after you close the poll.

     "1"        The number of votes that each voter gets.  If
                you're asking people to "Vote for 3", 3 goes
                here.  Note:  This word is optional.  If you
                don't put a number in this spot, eVote assumes
                that each voter has any number of votes to
                apply to the choices.  The maximum and minimum
                for each choice still apply.
            

Then comes the list of choices.  Each choice is followed by the 
vote limits for that choice.

Another example:
------- -------

-----------  cut here ------------------

eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]

Message:

Please help spend our budget.  We'll distribute our funds according
to the average of all our votes.  

--------   end of example ------------

This poll asks each of us to distribute 100 votes over 6 choices.
Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.  Apparently,
this list has a budget to spend and it spends it democratically by
dividing up the funds according to the outcome of the vote.


A Final Example:
- ----- --------

eVote poll group public visible
1.  I support the intent of this resolution [-10,10]
2.  This resolution is well-written [-10,10]

Message:

Resolved: In recognition of the direct attacks on cyberspace by
various world governments, cyberspace should declare itself an
independent state, and make and enforce its own rules and laws.

--------   end of example ------------

This poll is a group of questions but there is no "sum-limit".  There
are not a specified number of votes for the voters to distributed over
the two choices.  Each choice is rated independently.  

Warnings About Non-Public Polls
-------- ----- --- ------ -----

       Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
       members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
       computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
       records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
       ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
       ballot in transit.

       The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
       susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
       of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

       Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
       susceptible to attack at your own computer. 

Closing Your Poll
======= ==== ====

Through the regular mechanism, only the person who initiates the poll
can close it.  To close a poll, send email to
abc@xoko.  Use the same subject line to identify the
poll.  Have your message say:

eVote close

A message is sent to the list that announces the closing of the poll
and the closing statistics.  

The poll and the data remain in the data for at least 28 days so that
the voters can check that their vote is still as they intended, and,
on PUBLIC polls, they can check everyone's votes.

The list's owner can close any poll by using the list's password.
Also, the owner can close a poll and specify that an announcement
NOT be sent to the list.

Dropping Your Poll
======== ==== ====

After the poll has been closed for 28 days, the initiator of the
poll can remove it from the database by sending the command:

eVote drop

A message is sent to the list announcing that the poll has now been
dropped from the data.

After the poll has been closed for one year, anyone can drop it
from the database with the same command.

Also, any member of the list can drop a poll at any time, *if* there
have been no participants, i.e., no voters.

Again, the owner has overriding power to drop any poll at any time,
and even to do so silently.

Getting More Information
======= ==== ===========

Send the following commands to abc@xoko:

eVote help                  -   Sends general information about eVote.
                                The subject line is irrelevant
                                for this command.

eVote list                  -   Sends a list of all the subjects in 
                                the abc email list with 
                                polls attached.  The subject line of
                                your "eVote list" command is 
                                irrelevant.  
                  
                                Note: "eVote list sort=alpha" 
                                produces a sorted list.

eVote help poll             -   Sends this file.  Again, the subject 
                                line is irrelevant.

eVote info                  -   Sends information about the specific
                                poll attached to the subject line 
                                you specify in your email.  Included
                                are instructions for participating
                                in the poll, your vote if you have
                                voted, and the current tally if it
                                is available.

eVote stats                 -   Sends your vote if you have voted, 
                                and the current tally if it is
                                available.

eVote help who              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for all the people who have voted
                                "Yes" or "<5", etc., on the specific
                                poll attached to the subject you 
                                specify for your email message. 

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

eVote help how              -   Sends instructions for querying eVote
                                for how a particular subscriber voted
                                on the poll attached to the subject
                                you specify for your email message.

                                This feature is not available for 
                                all polls.

with the subject, "poll 2 choices", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

14 participants are asked to vote YES or NO on the following items:

    -    0      0     1. one choice

====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped [y/n] public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped [y/n] public visible".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote yes on choices 1 and 2, your message should say:

          eVote 
          1. y
          2. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your votes while the poll is open by voting again.

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 3 on choice 2 and 7 on choice 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 3
          3. 7

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 
1. -10
2. 0
3. 0

Your vote, 0, on "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #3:
"one more choice".

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "-10" on choice #1. "one choice".

Thank you for your "0" on choice #2. "another choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
will help with the error.

PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped numeric public visible".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 5 on item 2 and 11 on item 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 5
          3. 11

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each item that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that item.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Thank you for your unsubscribe message on the abc list.

Unsubscribing from the list deletes your ballot and subtracts your
your influence from the statistics.

Is this really what you want to do?

At this time, the flow of messages has been stopped and your ballot
has been put on "vacation" which means that you can send an
"eVote back" message to the list to resume the flow of mail and your
ballot will be as you left it.

If you really want to leave forever, you need to verify that the
"unsubscribe" message really came from you.

To verify that your message really came from you, please confirm
this message by using "Reply-To".  You don't need to type anything
new in your confirmation message.  eVote will read your subject line
and your address; everything else will be ignored.

====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big [y/n] poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "big [y/n] poll".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote yes on choices 1 and 50, your message should say:

          eVote 
          1. y
          50. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE

You can change your votes while the poll is open by voting again.

Thank you for your unsubscribe message on the abc list.

Unsubscribing from the list deletes your ballot and subtracts your
your influence from the statistics.

Is this really what you want to do?

At this time, the flow of messages has been stopped and your ballot
has been put on "vacation" which means that you can send an
"eVote back" message to the list to resume the flow of mail and your
ballot will be as you left it.

If you really want to leave forever, you need to verify that the
"unsubscribe" message really came from you.

To verify that your message really came from you, please confirm
this message by using "Reply-To".  You don't need to type anything
new in your confirmation message.  eVote will read your subject line
and your address; everything else will be ignored.

====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big [y/n] poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "big [y/n] poll".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote yes on choices 1 and 50, your message should say:

          eVote 
          1. y
          50. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your votes while the poll is open by voting again.


======== ==== ====
REMOVING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

To remove your votes on "big [y/n] poll", 
send the message:

	eVote remove


====== === ======= == === ====
SEEING THE RESULTS OF THE POLL
====== === ======= == === ====

To see the current vote tally on "big [y/n] poll", 
send the message:

	eVote info


==== ===========

PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big [y/n] poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "big [y/n] poll".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote yes on choices 1 and 50, your message should say:

          eVote 
          1. y
          50. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your votes while the poll is open by voting again.

REMOVING YOUR VOTE

Thank you for your unsubscribe message on the abc list.

Unsubscribing from the list deletes your ballot and subtracts your
your influence from the statistics.

Is this really what you want to do?

At this time, the flow of messages has been stopped and your ballot
has been put on "vacation" which means that you can send an
"eVote back" message to the list to resume the flow of mail and your
ballot will be as you left it.

If you really want to leave forever, you need to verify that the
"unsubscribe" message really came from you.

To verify that your message really came from you, please confirm
this message by using "Reply-To".  You don't need to type anything
new in your confirmation message.  eVote will read your subject line
and your address; everything else will be ignored.

          1. y
          50. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big [y/n] poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

          eVote 
          1. y
          50. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Thank you for your unsubscribe message on the abc list.

Unsubscribing from the list deletes your ballot and subtracts your
your influence from the statistics.

Is this really what you want to do?

At this time, the flow of messages has been stopped and your ballot
has been put on "vacation" which means that you can send an
"eVote back" message to the list to resume the flow of mail and your
ballot will be as you left it.

If you really want to leave forever, you need to verify that the
"unsubscribe" message really came from you.

To verify that your message really came from you, please confirm
this message by using "Reply-To".  You don't need to type anything
new in your confirmation message.  eVote will read your subject line
and your address; everything else will be ignored.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 
7. 40
80. 1
90. -1

Your vote, -1, on "big 1,99 poll" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #90:
"ninety".

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "40" on choice #7. "This is the seventh choice on this".

Thank you for your "1" on choice #80. "eighty".

Perhaps the instructions for "big 1,99 poll" 
will help with the error.

PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big 1,99 poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't

          2. 49
          100. 49

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 
7. 40

90. -1

Your vote, -1, on "big 1,99 poll" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #90:
"ninety".

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "40" on choice #7. "This is the seventh choice on this".

Thank you for your "1" on choice #80. "eighty".

Perhaps the instructions for "big 1,99 poll" 
will help with the error.

PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big 1,99 poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.

== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "big 1,99 poll".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

          eVote 
          2. 49
          100. 49

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 
7. 40
80. 1
90. -1

Your vote, -1, on "big 1,99 poll" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #90:
"ninety".

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "40" on choice #7. "This is the seventh choice on this".

Thank you for your "1" on choice #80. "eighty".

Perhaps the instructions for "big 1,99 poll" 
will help with the error.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

Your vote, -2, on "poll numeric private hidden"

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric private hidden"

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

       be counted!

       To vote 50, your message should say:

          eVote 50

       Your vote can be any number from 0 to 100.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 4

Your vote, 4, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden


==== ====
POLL TEXT

======= == ===
RESULTS SO FAR
======= == ===

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

1 subscriber to the abc list has voted so far. 

You have not yet voted.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric if-voted hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |

  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote

Your vote, 2, on "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #3:
"one more choice".

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "3" on choice #1. "one choice".

Thank you for your "5" on choice #2. "another choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric public visible"

and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

          3. 11

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each item that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that item.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote
1. 3
2. 5

Your vote of "5" on  choice #2. "another choice"
violates the sum-limit for "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl".  
It is not accepted.

Note that you are forced to vote the minimum on all the choices.

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "3" on choice #1. "one choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl" 
will help with the error.

Of the 14 people currently subscribed to the abc 
list, 2 have voted so far.

Participants are asked to distribute 10 votes over 
the following choices:

  Min   Max   Your  Average   On      
  Vote  Vote  Vote  Vote      Choice  

    1    10     3    2.5      1. one choice

You have used 7 of the 10 votes you are allotted 
for these choices.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 4

Your vote, 4, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden

POLL TEXT

======= == ===
RESULTS SO FAR
======= == ===

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

1 subscriber to the abc list has voted so far. 

You have not yet voted.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric if-voted hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |

  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your vote, 2, on "poll grouped numeric public visible"

and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

          2. 5
          3. 11

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each item that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that item.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote
1. 3
2. 5

Your vote of "5" on  choice #2. "another choice"
violates the sum-limit for "poll grouped numeric private hidden".  
It is not accepted.

Note that you are forced to vote the minimum on all the choices.

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "3" on choice #1. "one choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric private hidden" 
will help with the error.

Of the 14 people currently subscribed to the abc

Participants are asked to distribute 10 votes over 
the following choices:

  Min   Max   Your    On      
  Vote  Vote  Vote    Choice  

    1    10     3     1. one choice

You have used 7 of the 10 votes you are allotted 
for these choices.


======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped numeric private hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that

        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 3 on choice 2 and 7 on choice 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 3
          3. 7

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote -2

Your vote, -2, on "poll numeric private hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric private hidden" 
will help.

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked

======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 4

Your vote, 4, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden

POLL TEXT

======= == ===
RESULTS SO FAR
======= == ===

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

2 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have not yet voted.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric if-voted hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.


======== ==== ====
REMOVING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

To remove your vote on "poll numeric if-voted hidden",

PUBLIC POLL

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped numeric public visible".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 5 on item 2 and 11 on item 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 5
          3. 11

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each item that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that item.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric public hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.

       the minimum vote for that choice.

       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote

Your vote of "5" on  choice #2. "another choice"
violates the sum-limit for "poll grouped numeric private visible".  
It is not accepted.

Note that you are forced to vote the minimum on all the choices.

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "3" on choice #1. "one choice".

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote -2

Your vote, -2, on "poll numeric private hidden"

======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

          eVote 50

       Your vote can be any number from 0 to 100.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 4

Your vote, 4, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden

======= == ===

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

3 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have not yet voted.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric if-voted hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.

REMOVING YOUR VOTE

Your vote, 2, on "poll grouped numeric public visible"

mary8@somewhere.com's last eVote participation: 
	Mon Jan 20 10:30:54 2003

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote
1. 3
2. 5

Your vote of "5" on  choice #2. "another choice"
violates the sum-limit for "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl".  
It is not accepted.

Note that you are forced to vote the minimum on all the choices.

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "3" on choice #1. "one choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl" 
will help with the error.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:13:08 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl

Of the 14 people currently subscribed to the abc 
list, 7 have voted so far.

Participants are asked to distribute 10 votes over 
the following choices:

  Min   Max   Your  Average   On      
  Vote  Vote  Vote  Vote      Choice  

    1    10     3    2.6      1. one choice

    3    20     3    3.4      3. one more choice 

You have used 7 of the 10 votes you are allotted 
for these choices.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 3 on choice 2 and 7 on choice 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 3
          3. 7

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote -2

Your vote, -2, on "poll numeric private hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric private hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:01 -0800

RESULTS SO FAR

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked

8 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have voted 2.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric private hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 50, your message should say:

          eVote 50

       Your vote can be any number from 0 to 100.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.

======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

       Your vote can be any number from 1 to 88.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 4

Your vote, 4, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden

RESULTS SO FAR

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

4 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have not yet voted.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |

        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your vote, 2, on "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #3:
"one more choice".

Your command was partially completed:

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric public visible"

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

          eVote 
          2. 5
          3. 11

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each item that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that item.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped numeric private visible".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 3 on choice 2 and 7 on choice 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 3
          3. 7

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote

Your vote of "5" on  choice #2. "another choice"
violates the sum-limit for "poll grouped numeric private hidden".  
It is not accepted.

Note that you are forced to vote the minimum on all the choices.

Your command was partially completed:

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote -2

Your vote, -2, on "poll numeric private hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric private hidden" 
will help.

======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

       be counted!

       To vote 50, your message should say:

          eVote 50

       Your vote can be any number from 0 to 100.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 4

Your vote, 4, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden

POLL TEXT

======= == ===
RESULTS SO FAR
======= == ===

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

5 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have not yet voted.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric if-voted hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that

        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.

REMOVING YOUR VOTE

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote
1. 3
2. 5
3. 2

Your vote, 2, on "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #3:
"one more choice".

Your command was partially completed:

Thank you for your "3" on choice #1. "one choice".

Thank you for your "5" on choice #2. "another choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
will help with the error.

PRIVATE POLL

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote -2

Your vote, -2, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden


==== ====
POLL TEXT

bla


======= == ===
RESULTS SO FAR
======= == ===

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

6 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have voted 2.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric if-voted hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |

  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.

REMOVING YOUR VOTE

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote 4

Your vote, 4, on "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
is outside the vote limits.

Perhaps the instructions for "poll numeric if-voted hidden" 
will help.


On Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:10:09 -0800
mary@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	poll numeric if-voted hidden

RESULTS SO FAR

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote from 2 to 3.

6 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have voted 2.

The tally is not available until mary@somewhere.com 
closes the poll.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll numeric if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll numeric if-voted hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 2, your message should say:

          eVote 2

       Your vote can be any number from 2 to 3.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote
1. 3
2. 5
3. 2

Your vote, 2, on "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
is outside the vote limits for choice #3:
"one more choice".

Your command was partially completed:

Your vote has changed from "2" to "3" 
on choice #1. "one choice".

Your vote has changed from "0" to "5" 
on choice #2. "another choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric public visible"

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

          2. 5
          3. 11

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each item that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that item.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote
1. 3
2. 5

Your vote of "5" on  choice #2. "another choice"
violates the sum-limit for "poll grouped numeric private hidden".  
It is not accepted.

Note that you are forced to vote the minimum on all the choices.

Your command was partially completed:

Your vote has changed from "2" to "3" 
on choice #1. "one choice".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric private hidden" 
will help with the error.

Participants are asked to distribute 10 votes over 
the following choices:

  Vote  Vote  Vote    Choice  

    1    10     3     1. one choice

You have used 8 of the 10 votes you are allotted 
for these choices.


======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped numeric private hidden".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that

        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 3 on choice 2 and 7 on choice 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 3
          3. 7

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped [y/n] public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote yes on choices 1 and 2, your message should say:

          eVote 
          1. y
          2. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote yes or no.

12 subscribers to the abc list have voted so far. 

You have voted YES.

        12 --> = YES Votes

         0 --> = NO Votes


        -  --> = Ratio of YES/NO Votes


======= ====
PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped [y/n] public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.

          eVote 
          1. y
          2. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just

PRIVATE POLL

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

POLL TEXT

RESULTS SO FAR
======= == ===

Of the 14 people currently subscribed to the abc 
list, 11 have voted so far.

Participants are asked to vote YES on 1 of the following choices:

  Your  On      
  Vote  Choice  

   yes  1. one choice 
    no  2. another choice 

You have used 1 of your 1 YES votes.


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped [y/n] if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

       To vote yes on choice 2, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. y

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

IF_VOTED POLL

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric if-voted visibl", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

          eVote 
          1. y
          50. y

       You may make your list of votes as long as you wish.

       Every choice you don't vote "yes" on will receive an automatic
        "no" vote.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

with the subject, "big 1,99 poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

can monitor your votes too.

          100. 49

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.

       the minimum vote for that choice.

"poll [y/n] private visible".  The poll is a "private"

14 participants  12 voters 


YOUR COMMAND: eVote who 1. = 3 

Choice 1.  "one choice"  

Votes are from -10 to 10.

       3.2 --> Average of All Votes

Your command to eVote generated some confusion at this point:

eVote who 
1. = 3
4.

There are not 4 choices in the poll attached to 
"poll grouped numeric public visible".

Perhaps the instructions for "poll grouped numeric public visible" 
will help.

Of the 14 people currently subscribed to the abc 
list, 12 have voted so far.

Participants are asked to vote on the following items:

  Min   Max   Your  Average   On      
  Vote  Vote  Vote  Vote      Choice  

  -10    10     3    3.2      1. one choice

    3    20     5    3.8      3. one more choice 


====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll grouped numeric public visible", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "poll grouped numeric public visible".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 5 on item 2 and 11 on item 3, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 5
          3. 11

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each item that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that item.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE

You can change your votes while the poll is open by voting again.

====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big 1,99 poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "big 1,99 poll".

        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

          eVote 
          2. 49
          100. 49

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

==== ============
POLL INSTRUCTIONS
==== ============

The 14 participants of the abc list are asked
to vote yes or no.


====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "early dropper", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.

        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote YES, your message should say:

         eVote yes

       To vote NO, your message should say:

         eVote no

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

to vote yes or no.

        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote YES, your message should say:

         eVote yes

       To vote NO, your message should say:

         eVote no

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just

In response to your message:

eVote help info

eVote Information
===== ===========

The list-serving facility at xoko has "eVote" attached.  This
means that members of the abc list can poll each other.  Many
different types of polls are possible.

All messages that pertain to voting/polling *must* start with the
word, "eVote".  If you forget this, your message will be sent to the
entire abc list and it will not be processed by eVote.  So 
please be careful.

To learn how to set up a poll, or simply to understand eVote better,
send email to abc@xoko.  The subject line doesn't 
matter.  The message should say:

     eVote help poll

To receive a list of all the subjects for the abc list  
with polls attached, your message to abc@xoko 
should say:

    eVote list

You can use "eVote list open" to see which subjects have polls that
are open for voting.  "eVote list closed" will list the closed polls.

More information is available on a poll by poll basis.  To get 
information about the poll attached to the subject, "Favorite Movie",
send email to abc@xoko with "Favorite Movie" as the 
subject.  Your message can say:

eVote info        To learn how to participate in the poll, to see
                  your vote on this poll, and to see the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote stats       To see your vote on this poll and the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote who help    To learn how to query eVote with who-voted questions:
	          "Who voted yes?", "Who voted 10?", ...  whatever
                  makes sense for the particular poll.  This feature
                  is not available for all polls.
               
eVote how help    To learn how to query eVote for how a particular
                  subscriber voted, if this information is available.

Be aware that polls are identified by the first 36 characters of the
subject line of the message and case doesn't matter.  For example, if
someone on the abc list initiates a poll by sending an 
"eVote poll" command to abc@xoko with the subject, 
"Favorite Movie", all subsequent messages with the subject, "Favorite
Movie", or even "Re: FAVORITE MOVIE" and "Re:RE:favorite movie", and
with "eVote" as the first word of the message will be processed by
eVote as belonging to the established poll.  If "eVote" is not the
first word. The message is assumed to be part of the discussion about
"Favorite Movie" and it is distributed to all the members of the 
abc list.

Vacation
========

If you go on vacation, send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote vacation

eVote will stop the flow of messages but will keep your ballot for
you.  If you unsubscribe your ballot will be dropped as well as your
influence on the statistics.


Moving
======

If you move your email address, notify your list's owner.  Your owner
can move your address and preserve your ballot.

If you belong to several eVoted lists at xoko, you only need to
notify one list owner of your move.  eVote will move your address for
all lists and notify all your lists' owners.


Members
=======

To receive a list of eVote's notion of the members of the abc list,
send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote members

The list you receive will tell you who is on vacation and which 
members are really archive addresses without eVoting privileges.

End
===

If you attach a signature to your email messages, end your eVote
commands with a line that says "end".

Bugs
====

If you find a bug, pleas report it to eVote-users@deliberate.com.
This is an email list which you are welcome to join.

eVote Information
===== ===========

The list-serving facility at xoko has "eVote" attached.  This
means that members of the abc list can poll each other.  Many
different types of polls are possible.

All messages that pertain to voting/polling *must* start with the
word, "eVote".  If you forget this, your message will be sent to the
entire abc list and it will not be processed by eVote.  So 
please be careful.

To learn how to set up a poll, or simply to understand eVote better,
send email to abc@xoko.  The subject line doesn't 
matter.  The message should say:

     eVote help poll

To receive a list of all the subjects for the abc list  
with polls attached, your message to abc@xoko 
should say:

    eVote list

You can use "eVote list open" to see which subjects have polls that
are open for voting.  "eVote list closed" will list the closed polls.

More information is available on a poll by poll basis.  To get 
information about the poll attached to the subject, "Favorite Movie",
send email to abc@xoko with "Favorite Movie" as the 
subject.  Your message can say:

eVote info        To learn how to participate in the poll, to see
                  your vote on this poll, and to see the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote stats       To see your vote on this poll and the current
                  tally, if it is available.

eVote who help    To learn how to query eVote with who-voted questions:
	          "Who voted yes?", "Who voted 10?", ...  whatever
                  makes sense for the particular poll.  This feature
                  is not available for all polls.
               
eVote how help    To learn how to query eVote for how a particular
                  subscriber voted, if this information is available.

Be aware that polls are identified by the first 36 characters of the
subject line of the message and case doesn't matter.  For example, if
someone on the abc list initiates a poll by sending an 
"eVote poll" command to abc@xoko with the subject, 
"Favorite Movie", all subsequent messages with the subject, "Favorite
Movie", or even "Re: FAVORITE MOVIE" and "Re:RE:favorite movie", and
with "eVote" as the first word of the message will be processed by
eVote as belonging to the established poll.  If "eVote" is not the
first word. The message is assumed to be part of the discussion about
"Favorite Movie" and it is distributed to all the members of the 
abc list.

Vacation
========

If you go on vacation, send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote vacation

eVote will stop the flow of messages but will keep your ballot for
you.  If you unsubscribe your ballot will be dropped as well as your
influence on the statistics.


Moving
======

If you move your email address, notify your list's owner.  Your owner
can move your address and preserve your ballot.

If you belong to several eVoted lists at xoko, you only need to
notify one list owner of your move.  eVote will move your address for
all lists and notify all your lists' owners.


Members
=======

To receive a list of eVote's notion of the members of the abc list,
send the following message to abc@xoko:

eVote members

The list you receive will tell you who is on vacation and which 
members are really archive addresses without eVoting privileges.

End
===

If you attach a signature to your email messages, end your eVote
commands with a line that says "end".

Bugs
====

If you find a bug, pleas report it to eVote-users@deliberate.com.
This is an email list which you are welcome to join.

PRIVATE POLL

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

	poll [y/n] if-voted hidden

This poll was opened for voting on Mon, 20 Jan 2003 10:09:41 -0800

RESULTS
=======

When this poll closed, there were 14 participants.
The participants of the abc list were asked
to vote yes or no.

12 subscribers to the abc list voted. 

You voted YES.

        12 --> = YES Votes

         0 --> = NO Votes


        -  --> = Ratio of YES/NO Votes


======== ====
IF_VOTED POLL
======== ====

This is an "if-voted" poll.  This means you can send email to

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "poll [y/n] if-voted hidden", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of those who voted.  Of course, everyone else
on the abc list can see if you have voted too.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

PRIVATE POLL
======= ====

This is a "private" poll; ballots are secret.

Warnings: Although eVote will not reveal your vote to the other
members of the voting community, the system administrator of the
computer that stores your vote can quite easily see the voting
records of individuals. Also, there is the possibility that your
ballot can be seen by a "snooper", someone who intercepts your 
ballot in transit.

The integrity of the poll, i.e., the accuracy of the count, is
susceptible to being tampered with by the system administrator
of the computer running the eVote(R)/Clerk software.

Both the privacy of your vote and the integrity of the poll are
susceptible to attack at your own computer.

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	abc@xoko

with the subject, "big 1,99 poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.  The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the abc list
can monitor your votes too.

TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to abc@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "big 1,99 poll".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire abc list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 49 on choice 2 and 49 on choice 100, your message should say:

          eVote 
          2. 49
          100. 49

       You can make your list of votes as long as necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will automatically receive 
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.
