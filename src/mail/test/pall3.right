	numeric poll


==== ====
POLL TEXT

nothing to say


==== ============
POLL INSTRUCTIONS
==== ============

The 3 participants of the petitionbutalonglonglongname list are asked
to vote from 1 to 10.


====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	petitionbutalonglonglongname@xoko

with the subject, "numeric poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the petitionbutalonglonglongname list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to petitionbutalonglonglongname@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "numeric poll".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire petitionbutalonglonglongname list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 5, your message should say:

          eVote 5

       Your vote can be any number from 1 to 10.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.


======== ==== ====
REMOVING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

To remove your vote on "numeric poll", 
send the message:

	eVote remove


====== === ======= == === ====
SEEING THE RESULTS OF THE POLL
====== === ======= == === ====

To see the current vote tally on "numeric poll", 
send the message:

	eVote info


==== ===========
MORE INFORMATION
==== ===========

To receive more information about "numeric poll":

1.  Send a message to:

	petitionbutalonglonglongname@xoko

2.  Your subject must be:

	numeric poll

3.  Your message should say:

	eVote help who

to learn details about the WHO command.

If your message says:

	eVote how Charlie@somewhere.com

you will receive a message reporting Charlie's vote.
To see your own vote, the current vote tally, and this
information again, send the command:

	eVote info

For a general explanation of eVote/Majordomo, use any 
subject line, and send the message:

	eVote help

pollster2@somewhere.com's last eVote participation: 
	Tue Jun  4 08:18:19 2003

In response to your message:

eVote poll [y/n] private visible
form:
*address:
*address:

----
Each field must have a unique name.  
You have two fields called "address".

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:


This list is for administrators of petitions.  We can talk to each
other by sending messages to the petition list address, just like a
regular email list.  Also, we can take regular polls between ourselves
*except* for [y/n] polls, they will be interpreted as a new petition
and have a totally different behavior, as explained below.

Generating Simple Petitions
========== ====== =========

To generate a simple petition, i.e., one without fields:

1.  Choose your subject line carefully, say "Save the World".

2.  Send a message to petition@your-domain.org with your subject.

3.  Make the message say:

---  cut  ---
eVote petition public
message:
Type in the text of your petition.
---  cut  ---

4.  Advertise the following instructions:

= * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * 

To Sign The Petition
== ==== === ========

1.  Send email to eVote@your-domain.org.

2.  Make your subject be "Save the World" (really, the subject line of
    your poll).

3.  Have the message be your name, affiliation, comments, whatever.

= * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * 

When anyone signs your petition, they will be sent a receipt which
tells them the text of the petitition and gives instructions for
unsigning and for seeing the signatures, if it's a PUBLIC petition.

Your audience can see the petition text without signing if they:

1.  Send email to eVote@your-domain.org.

2.  Make your subject be "Save the World" (really, the subject line of
your poll).

3.  Have the message say:

   info


Initializing Petitions With Required Fields
============ ========= ==== ======== ======

eVote's petition facility supports forms.  That is, eVote will
recognize field names in the signature message, demand that certain
fields be filled in, and demand that a certain format be followed in
the field for the signature to be accepted.

If the attempt to sign is rejected, polite instructions will be
sent to the failed signer.

To set up a petition that requires a form, your instruction to the
petition list might look like:

eVote petition public
form:
*name:
address:
city:
* state: XX
* zip: 99999
phone:
comment:
message:
Please fix the roof.
--- end of example ---

In this case signatures will be rejected if they don't include the
three fields, name, state, and zip.  That's the meaning of the '*' in
the first column.  

In the example, the required "name:" field must have something on it,
but only the existence of some text on the line is verified.  The
state field must be filled in with two letters.  The zip field must
contain 6 numbers, no more, no less.  You may mix X's and 9's in one
field's format.

The other, non-required, fields may or may not be in the signature and
if they are, they may be in any order. If the non-required fields are
in the signature message, then in the resulting signature file, the
fields will appear in the correct order.  X's and 9's can be included
in non-required fields but they will only be aids to the signers, they
are not checked.

The "comment:" field is special.  If it is in the list of fields, it
must be the last field.  The comment field allows the response to be
of any length, any number of lines.

Also, if there is no comment field, there is still a hidden comment
field.  Comments are always allowed in a petition with fields and any
text recognized as a comment from the signer is included in this
field.

The comment field can be a required field, just like any other field.

You can use any words or phrases for the names of your fields.  The
size limit is 40 characters.  You may not have two fields with exactly
the same name.

The "message:" line signals the end of the fields and all text after
that will be part of the petition text itself.


For The Petition Initiator
=== === ======== =========

You interact with your petition through the petition email list.  The
same commands are available to you on the petition list as are on any
other eVoted list.  This petition list has the extra facility that
"votes" can be cast (really, signatures are collected) when mail is
received by the eVote@your-domain.org address.  Any mail received
through that address will cause the message body to be appended to the
signature file for the particular petition.

Also, the petition list allows the retrieval of the signature file:

1.  Send a message to petition@your-domain.org

2.  Make the subject match the title of your petition

3.  In the message, say:

eVote names

If your original command was "eVote poll [y/n] public visible", as
above, anyone on this list, and any of your signers, can use the
"eVote names" command to retrieve the signatures for the petition.  If
this is undesirable, originate your petition with this command
instead:

eVote poll [y/n] private visible

Then, only you can retrieve the signatures.


Vacation
========

eVote has a "vacation" feature.  If you want to stop the flow of
messages from this list (probably none anyway) but retain your
electronic ballot and your influence on the statistics, send this
message to petition@your-domain.org:

      eVote vacation

In response to your message:

eVote poll [y/n] private visible
form:
Here is a field that goes on and on and won't end even when it should end before 100

----
Your field names must be less than 80 characters each.

Perhaps eVote's instructions will help:


This list is for administrators of petitions.  We can talk to each
other by sending messages to the petition list address, just like a
regular email list.  Also, we can take regular polls between ourselves
*except* for [y/n] polls, they will be interpreted as a new petition
and have a totally different behavior, as explained below.

Generating Simple Petitions
========== ====== =========

To generate a simple petition, i.e., one without fields:

1.  Choose your subject line carefully, say "Save the World".

2.  Send a message to petition@your-domain.org with your subject.

3.  Make the message say:

---  cut  ---
eVote petition public
message:
Type in the text of your petition.
---  cut  ---

4.  Advertise the following instructions:

= * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * 

To Sign The Petition
== ==== === ========

1.  Send email to eVote@your-domain.org.

2.  Make your subject be "Save the World" (really, the subject line of
    your poll).

3.  Have the message be your name, affiliation, comments, whatever.

= * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * 

When anyone signs your petition, they will be sent a receipt which
tells them the text of the petitition and gives instructions for
unsigning and for seeing the signatures, if it's a PUBLIC petition.

Your audience can see the petition text without signing if they:

1.  Send email to eVote@your-domain.org.

2.  Make your subject be "Save the World" (really, the subject line of
your poll).

3.  Have the message say:

   info


Initializing Petitions With Required Fields
============ ========= ==== ======== ======

eVote's petition facility supports forms.  That is, eVote will
recognize field names in the signature message, demand that certain
fields be filled in, and demand that a certain format be followed in
the field for the signature to be accepted.

If the attempt to sign is rejected, polite instructions will be
sent to the failed signer.

To set up a petition that requires a form, your instruction to the
petition list might look like:

eVote petition public
form:
*name:
address:
city:
* state: XX
* zip: 99999
phone:
comment:
message:
Please fix the roof.
--- end of example ---

In this case signatures will be rejected if they don't include the
three fields, name, state, and zip.  That's the meaning of the '*' in
the first column.  

In the example, the required "name:" field must have something on it,
but only the existence of some text on the line is verified.  The
state field must be filled in with two letters.  The zip field must
contain 6 numbers, no more, no less.  You may mix X's and 9's in one
field's format.

The other, non-required, fields may or may not be in the signature and
if they are, they may be in any order. If the non-required fields are
in the signature message, then in the resulting signature file, the
fields will appear in the correct order.  X's and 9's can be included
in non-required fields but they will only be aids to the signers, they
are not checked.

The "comment:" field is special.  If it is in the list of fields, it
must be the last field.  The comment field allows the response to be
of any length, any number of lines.

Also, if there is no comment field, there is still a hidden comment
field.  Comments are always allowed in a petition with fields and any
text recognized as a comment from the signer is included in this
field.

The comment field can be a required field, just like any other field.

You can use any words or phrases for the names of your fields.  The
size limit is 40 characters.  You may not have two fields with exactly
the same name.

The "message:" line signals the end of the fields and all text after
that will be part of the petition text itself.


For The Petition Initiator
=== === ======== =========

You interact with your petition through the petition email list.  The
same commands are available to you on the petition list as are on any
other eVoted list.  This petition list has the extra facility that
"votes" can be cast (really, signatures are collected) when mail is
received by the eVote@your-domain.org address.  Any mail received
through that address will cause the message body to be appended to the
signature file for the particular petition.

Also, the petition list allows the retrieval of the signature file:

1.  Send a message to petition@your-domain.org

2.  Make the subject match the title of your petition

3.  In the message, say:

eVote names

If your original command was "eVote poll [y/n] public visible", as
above, anyone on this list, and any of your signers, can use the
"eVote names" command to retrieve the signatures for the petition.  If
this is undesirable, originate your petition with this command
instead:

eVote poll [y/n] private visible

Then, only you can retrieve the signatures.


Vacation
========

eVote has a "vacation" feature.  If you want to stop the flow of
messages from this list (probably none anyway) but retain your
electronic ballot and your influence on the statistics, send this
message to petition@your-domain.org:

      eVote vacation

To see who is subscribed to the petition list, send this message to
petition@your-domain.org:

      eVote members

The list you receive will tell you which members are on vacation and
which email addresses on the list are archives, meaning they have no
eVoting privileges, which are simply signers to the petition.
