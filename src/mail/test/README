This directory has a series of tests for the mail interface.

To use these tests, place

MAILER = /home/eVote/src/mail/test/smail_test  -t
PROGS = /home/eVote/src/mail

in your eVote.cf file.

These all have "eVote@xoko", "majordomo@xoko", etc in them.  You need
to make the "xoko" be your domain, I think.  You'll want to edit all
the *.right files to have your domain or the diffs will be difficult
to read.

For vacation, you must change the #define TESTING in ../mailui/util.c
so that #define TESTING 1, and compile.  Be sure to put it back and
recompile when you're finished or all the confirm keys will be 111111,
not very secure!

A make in this directory makes the smail_test and the resend_test
programs which capture the output all to the various *.out files.

It has the output from the last mail transaction in ./tmp/r.out or
./tmp/s.out, which it then appends to the *.out in this directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
| Your majordomo's list directory gets manipulated in this process.|
| In particular, the "bounces" list gets erased.  Check the mclean |
| script to see what files get created and removed.                |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These tests expect some files in majordomo's list directory. All these
are in ./lists.  The mscratch script sets it up for you -- and wipes out
your majordomo/lists directory!

big: abc.config yyy.config 
drops: droppings.config 
     droppings.passwd = XXXX 
pet: xxxx.config petitiona.config petitiona.passwd = squash 
pet2: petition.info 
pet3: petitionbutalonglonglongname.passwd = pass 
par: participants.config 
vacation: iag.passwd = Cthulhu and the iag list itself: 
madavis "democracy rules", 
btherl@mundil.cs.mu.OZ.AU (whynot), 
(hows this) aried@xs4all.nl "more", 
"more" Neal.Weidenhofer@mri.com (how), 
"harry" harry@tigger.jvnc.net, 
(nutt) nutt@kcnet.com, 
andyo@ora.com (andy), 
baby-x@zoom.com "baby",
bass@tenet.edu (what) "xxx", 
"xxx" droplonder@odb.rhein-main.de,
papadop@peak.org, 
(what) sap@tank.rgs.uky.edu,

All these are in ./lists and are automatically copied and deleted
by the scripts.

To run each test, call the "cscratch" script as clerk first and
"mscratch" as majordom: 

As majordom (actually, you can skip this step because the tests
             call mscratch, but you must do the cscratch as clerk)

mscratch LISTDIR    (default LISTDIR is /home/majordomo)

As clerk:

eVote_cscratch EVOTE_HOME_DIR     (default is /home)

Note that cscratch should already be copied into your
$(EVOTE_BIN) directory as eVote_cscratch and it should have good
permissions -- from doing the make install in
$(EVOTE_HOME_DIR)/eVote/src

For example, to run the big test:

NOTE: If you did a "make install" at ../.. then cscratch, cres and
csetup are in $(EVOTE_BIN) as eVote_cscratch, eVote_cres, and
eVote_csetup and owned and runnable by clerk.

big UI_BIN &   (default UI_BIN is /home/majordomo)

big's output is all.out.  Do:

compare.pl  all.out all.right 

and check the differences in compare.out.

To find bugs:

*  Make a copy of the offending message, save it as ./x.

*  Take a note of command line as reported just above the offending
   message.

*  Put "exit" in the test script just before the offending message.

*  Run cscratch as clerk and mscratch as majordom.

*  Rerun the test script so that exits just before the offending message.

*  Run "csetup" as clerk and "msetup" as majordom -- so that you can 
   duplicate the setup.

*  Edit the ../.gdbinit to get the right command line.  Note that when
   you first install or make from ../../src, you don't get symbol info
   in your executables but if you make clean in .. (mail) and make
   again, you'll be ready for the debugger.  Also, note that, just
   before the offending message in the test's output, you can find
   the call and arguments that produced the error.

*  Debug.

*  To repeat a debug session, run "cres" as clerk, "mres" as majordomo, 
   and go again.

To do drops and pet, first recompile the Clerk with #define INFO_PERM
and DATA_PERM 644 in EVOTE_HOME_DIR/eVote/src/Clerk/evotedef.h
(usually it's 600) and open the permissions on
EVOTE_HOME_DIR/eVote/data so that majordom can read the who.list.

Also, for pet, you need to change the permission on eVote_Clerk so
that everyone can execute it.  Usually the permission is
---x------ -- only clerk can execute it.

Probably only deliberate.com wants to run kop and kop2.  For these
tests, ../mailui needs to be compiled with -DROSA.  For kop2, you need
the existing data from deliberate.com's production machine, Rosa.
Kop2 tries to ftp to a live web site so for this one, you want to
jimmy the data so that it doesn't generate reports.  To do this,
in $LISTDIR/../polls/petitiona/Kopilli/report_instructions, change
the number of reports to be 0.

Put the permission back when you're done!

So, the tests and their arguments and output files to check against are:

(default UI_BIN = /home/majordomo
 default LISTDIR = /home/majordomo/lists
 default EVOTE_HOME_DIR = /home)

big UI_BIN                        ---> all.right  Tests polling and voting
drops UI_BIN EVOTE_HOME_DIR     ---> dall.right Tests dropping people and polls
vacation UI_BIN LISTDIR           ---> vall.right Tests the vacation feature
pet UI_BIN LISTDIR EVOTE_HOME_DIR ---> pall.right Tests petitions
pet2 UI_BIN LISTDIR EVOTE_HOME_DIR ---> pall2.right Tests forms in petitions
pet3 UI_BIN LISTDIR EVOTE_HOME_DIR ---> pall3.right Tests end keyword
pet4 UI_BIN LISTDIR                ---> pall4.right Multi-lingual tests
con UI_BIN LISTDIR                 ---> con.right Tests multi-lingual petitions
                                        in 4 langauages with votes.
par UI_BIN LISTDIR                 ---> par.right Tests
                                        sync/read-only/no_of_participants
Note, kop and kop2 only work if #define ROSA in the ../mailui.  You probably
don't want to use these.  See above to see how special they are.
kop          --->    kall.right       Special test for Kopilli Ketzalli
kop2         --->    kall2.right      Special test for KK and Chiapas Peace

Putting things back:

Don't forget to put #define TESTING 0 in ../mailui/util.c

Please replace the permissions on /home/eVote/data
and replace the Clerk's DATA_PERM and INFO_PERM in 
../../Clerk/evotedef.h to be 0600

Good luck!

Again, good luck!
