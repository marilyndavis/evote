EisenSLC@aol.com attached a poll to this subject:

	A


==== ====
POLL TEXT
==== ====

bla


==== ============
POLL INSTRUCTIONS
==== ============

The 9 participants of the participants list are asked
to vote yes or no.


====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	participants@xoko

with the subject, "A", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the participants list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to participants@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "A".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire participants list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote YES, your message should say:

         eVote yes

       To vote NO, your message should say:

         eVote no

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.


======== ==== ====
REMOVING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

To remove your vote on "A", 
send the message:

	eVote remove


====== === ======= == === ====
SEEING THE RESULTS OF THE POLL
====== === ======= == === ====

To see the current vote tally on "A", 
send the message:

	eVote info


==== ===========
MORE INFORMATION
==== ===========

To receive more information about "A":

1.  Send a message to:

	participants@xoko

2.  Your subject must be:

	A

3.  Your message should say:

	eVote help who

to learn details about the WHO command.

If your message says:

	eVote how Charlie@somewhere.com

you will receive a message reporting Charlie's vote.
To see your own vote, the current vote tally, and this
information again, send the command:

	eVote info

For a general explanation of eVote/Majordomo, use any 
subject line, and send the message:

	eVote help
