# mres -- Majordomo's reset program
# To use this, you should have already run msetup when the environment
# was right ready to produce a bug.  This program will set things up
# to produce that bug again.
#
# This should be run under the majordom login.
#
#  Also run cres as the clerk login.
#
# By default, it thinks that "home/majordomo" is LISTDIR.  Give
# the path as an argument if that's not right for you.
