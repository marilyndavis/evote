pollster1@somewhere.com attached a poll to this subject:

	numeric poll


==== ====
POLL TEXT
==== ====

nothing to say


==== ============
POLL INSTRUCTIONS
==== ============

The 3 participants of the petitiona list are asked
to vote from 1 to 10.


====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	petitiona@xoko

with the subject, "numeric poll", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the petitiona list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to petitiona@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "numeric poll".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire petitiona list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 5, your message should say:

          eVote 5

       Your vote can be any number from 1 to 10.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.


======== ==== ====
REMOVING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

To remove your vote on "numeric poll", 
send the message:

	eVote remove


====== === ======= == === ====
SEEING THE RESULTS OF THE POLL
====== === ======= == === ====

To see the current vote tally on "numeric poll", 
send the message:

	eVote info


==== ===========
MORE INFORMATION
==== ===========

To receive more information about "numeric poll":

1.  Send a message to:

	petitiona@xoko

2.  Your subject must be:

	numeric poll

3.  Your message should say:

	eVote help who

to learn details about the WHO command.

If your message says:

	eVote how Charlie@somewhere.com

you will receive a message reporting Charlie's vote.
To see your own vote, the current vote tally, and this
information again, send the command:

	eVote info

For a general explanation of eVote/Majordomo, use any 
subject line, and send the message:

	eVote help

PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll.  This means you can send email to 

	petitiona@xoko

with the subject, "numeric", 
and with a message that says: 

         eVote who

to receive a list of everyone's votes.

Of course, everyone else on the petitiona list
can monitor your votes too.


== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to petitiona@xoko.
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "numeric".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----> *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy.  Just use *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, "eVote", or your
       vote will be sent to the entire petitiona list and it won't
       be counted!

       To vote 5, your message should say:

          eVote 5

       Your vote can be any number from -10 to 10.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other text
       below your vote, make a line that says, "end" just
       after your vote.

======== ==== ====
CHANGING YOUR VOTE
======== ==== ====

You can change your vote while the poll is open by voting again.

REMOVING YOUR VOTE

To remove your vote on "numeric", 
send the message:

SEEING THE RESULTS OF THE POLL

There is no petition attached to the subject, "wrong title".

Please check the spelling on the subject line of your message.

The petitions currently available at xoko are listed below.

Privacy
=======

In the list below:

PUBLIC  petitions allow anyone on the petitiona@xoko
        list to retrieve the signatures, but not the email addresses,  
        attached to the petition.  Also, anyone who signs the petition
        can retrieve the signatures.  There are no controls on the use
        of your signature.  Your email address is used to ensure that there
        is only one signature per address and for no other purpose.

PRIVATE petitions allow only the petition's initiator and the system
        administrator at xoko to retrieve the signatures.
        The email addresses are available to both people as well.

There is one PUBLIC petition:

1poll1

PRIVATE petitions:
