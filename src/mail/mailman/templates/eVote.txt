%(real_name)s@%(host_name)s has the "eVote" feature to enable voting
by email for this list.

Most messages that are sent to the address %(real_name)s@%(host_name)s
will be forwarded to all the members of the list.  However, if your
message starts with the word "eVote", instead, it will be processed by
eVote.

Because this list is eVoted, anyone on this list can generate a poll
for the list members to vote on.

To see what polls are open for this list, send the message:

     eVote list

to %(real_name)s@%(host_name)s.

To learn more about eVote, send the message:

     eVote help

to %(real_name)s@%(host_name)s.


If you move your email address, notify %(real_name)s-admin@%(host_name)s.  
The administrator can move your address and preserve your ballot.

If you belong to several eVoted lists at this site, you only need to
notify one list administrator of your move.  eVote will move your
address for all lists and notify all your lists' administrators.


To see who is subscribed to the eVote_sample list, according to eVote,
send this message to %(real_name)s@%(host_name)s.

      eVote members

The list you receive will tell you which members are on vacation and
which email addresses on the list are archives, meaning they have no
eVoting privileges.


If you have a signature on your message, add a line with "end" when
you communicate with eVote.


If you find a bug in eVote, please report it to bugs@deliberate.com.
