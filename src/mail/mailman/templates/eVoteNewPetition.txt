This is a "petition" list.  Your list members can collaborate in the
administration of petitions that anyone can sign.

You can remove a signature from a petition.  The subject line for your
message to %(listname)s@%(hostname)s should refere to an established
petition.

    eVote approve %(password)s unsign <address> <address> <...>

        This will remove the signatures from the signature file as
        well as the email address from eVote's data.  It will alter
        the count and ship updated reports.
