Your list is eVoted!  List members can poll each other and make
decisions.

eVote Commands
===== ========

You can use your same password, %(password)s, for the following eVote
commands.  Send these commands directly to your list address:
%(listname)s@%(hostname)s

The subject line should refer to an established poll for these
commands:

    eVote approve %(password)s close

        closes the established poll.  Notice is sent to all
        subscribers that you have forced the closing of the poll.
        Usually the member who initiates the poll closes it.

    eVote approve %(password)s drop

        drops the poll from the database.  Notice is sent to all
        subscribers.

    eVote approve %(password)s drop silent

        drops the poll from the database.  No notice is sent to
        the subscribers.

For the following commands the subject line is irrelevant.  Once
again, these commands should be sent to the %(listname)s@%(hostname)s.

    eVote approve %(password)s move <old-address> <new-address>

        moves the address while it retains the ballot.  This command
        moves the address for all lists run at this site.

    eVote approve %(password)s no-vote <address>

        changes the <address> to a non-voter.  This is useful for
        archive addresses.


    eVote approve %(password)s vote_only <address>

        Use this command *after* the address already has "nomail = ON"
        to allow the address to vote, even though it is not receiving
        mail.
